## Writing Tips

### Story Arc
**Setup:** Context and problem
**Conflict:** Challenges faced
**Resolution:** Solution and impact

### Show, Don't Just Tell
❌ "I improved the UX"
✅ "I redesigned the checkout flow, reducing steps from 7 to 4, which increased completion by 35%"

### Be Specific
❌ "Users were confused"
✅ "In testing, 6 of 8 users couldn't find the submit button, abandoning the task"

### Use Numbers
- How many users
- How many interviews
- Percentage improvements
- Time saved
- Money earned/saved

### Include Visuals
- High-quality screenshots
- Annotated wireframes
- Before/after comparisons
- User flow diagrams
- Research artifacts
- Process photos

### Keep It Concise
- 800-1500 words ideal
- Scannable headers
- Bullet points
- Pull quotes
- Visual hierarchy

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Avoid:**
- Only showing final designs
- No process or thinking
- Vague impact ("improved UX")
- No research/data
- Just personal preferences
- No reflection
- Too long and dense
- Only successful projects
- Violating NDAs

✅ **Do:**
- Show your process
- Explain your thinking
- Quantify impact
- Include research
- Be honest about challenges
- Reflect on learnings
- Edit ruthlessly
- Include failures/pivots
- Respect confidentiality

- Have context (device mockups)
- Be annotated (explain what we're seeing)
- Tell the story

**Variety:**
- Wide shots (full pages)
- Details (components)
- Process (sketches, workshops)
- Data (charts, metrics)
- People (team, users - with permission)

## NDA Considerations

**If under NDA:**
