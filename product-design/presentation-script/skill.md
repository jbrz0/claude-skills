## Speaking Notes Format

### Slide-by-Slide Script

```markdown
## Slide 1: Title
**Show:** Project title and your name
**Say:** 
"Good morning. Today I'm excited to share our redesign of the mobile checkout experience. Over the next 20 minutes, I'll walk you through the problem, our research, the solution, and the impressive results we're seeing in testing."

**Timing:** 30 seconds

## Slide 2: The Problem
**Show:** Screenshot of current checkout with pain points highlighted
**Say:**
"Let's start with the problem. Our current checkout has a 60% abandonment rate on mobile - meaning 6 out of 10 users who add items to cart never complete purchase. That's millions in lost revenue annually.

When we dug into the data, we found users were abandoning at the payment info step. The question was: why?"

**Timing:** 1 minute
**Note:** Pause for questions if anyone looks confused

## Slide 3: User Research
**Show:** Research highlights with user quote
**Say:**
"We conducted 12 user interviews and usability tests. What we found was eye-opening.

[Read quote from slide]

Users weren't confident their payment was secure. They couldn't see what they were buying. And they had to remember their shipping address.

These three insights became our design drivers."

**Timing:** 2 minutes
**Demo:** If time, show quick clip of user struggling
