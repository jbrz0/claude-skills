- Qualitative (satisfaction, feedback)
- Timeline for measurement

**Example:**
- Increase mobile checkout completion from 40% to 60%
- Reduce support tickets about checkout by 50%
- Improve mobile satisfaction score from 3.2 to 4.0
- Measure after 2 weeks in production

### 5. Target Audience

**Primary users:**
- Demographics

### 6. Scope

**In scope:**
- What's included
- Features/flows
- Platforms
- Deliverables

**Out of scope:**

### 8. Approach & Methodology

**Design process:**
- Research phase
- Ideation approach
- Prototyping plan
- Testing strategy

**Collaboration:**

**Example:**
"Week 1-2: User research (8 interviews, usability testing)
Week 3-4: Ideation and wireframing
Week 5-6: High-fidelity design
Week 7-8: Prototype and user testing
Week 9-10: Iteration and handoff
Week 11-12: Development support"
