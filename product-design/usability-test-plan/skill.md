# Usability Test Planning

Expert in planning and conducting usability tests. Help designers create comprehensive test plans that validate designs with real users.

## Task
Guide creation of detailed usability test plans that generate actionable insights about how users interact with designs.

## Usability Test Types

### 1. Moderated In-Person
- Researcher and participant together
- Real-time probing
- Rich insights
- Time/location constraints

### 2. Moderated Remote
- Video call with participant
- More flexible scheduling
- Broader geography
- Technical setup needed

### 3. Unmoderated Remote
- Participant completes alone
- Scalable, cheaper
- Less rich insights
- Specific tasks only

### 4. Guerrilla Testing
- Quick, informal
- Public spaces
- Fast feedback
- Less rigorous

## Test Plan Components

### 1. Test Objectives
**What to learn:**
- Can users complete task X?
- Do users understand feature Y?
- Where do users get confused?
- How satisfied are users?

**Research questions:**
- Specific, measurable
- Tied to design decisions
- Prioritized

### 2. Methodology
**Format:** Moderated/unmoderated, remote/in-person
**Duration:** Per session (45-60 min typical)
**Number of participants:** 5-8 for qualitative
**Prototype fidelity:** Wireframes, high-fi, live product

### 3. Participant Criteria
**Who to recruit:**
- Demographics (age, location)
- Behaviors (frequency of use)
- Experience level (novice, expert)
- Specific requirements

**Screening:**
- Screener questions
- Quotas per segment
- Exclusion criteria

**Recruitment:**
- User research panels
- Customer lists
- Social media
- Recruitment agencies
- Incentive amount

### 4. Test Materials

**Prototype/Product:**
- What's being tested
- Access method
- Known limitations

**Tasks:**
- 3-5 realistic scenarios
- Natural language
- Specific success criteria

**Script:**
- Introduction
- Consent
- Task instructions
- Probing questions
- Wrap-up

**Survey:**
- SUS (System Usability Scale)
- Custom satisfaction questions
- Demographics

### 5. Success Metrics

**Task-based:**
- Completion rate (%)
- Time on task
- Errors made
- Assistance needed

**Satisfaction:**
- SUS score (0-100)
- Ease rating (1-5)
- Likelihood to recommend

**Behavioral:**
- Click path
- Hesitations
- Backtracking
- Confusion points

### 6. Test Tasks

**Good task characteristics:**
- Realistic scenario
- Specific goal
- Open-ended approach
- Not leading

**Example task:**

✅ Good: "You want to save this report for later. 
Show me how you would do that."
```

**Task components:**
- Scenario/context
- Goal/objective
- Starting point
- Success criteria

### 7. Test Script

**Introduction (5 min)**
- Welcome
- Explain think-aloud
- Set expectations
- Get consent
- Start recording

**Background Questions (5 min)**
- Warm-up questions
- Understand context
- Build rapport

**Tasks (30-40 min)**
- Present scenario
- Observe attempt
- Minimal intervention
- Probe for reasoning

**Wrap-up (5 min)**
- Overall impressions
- What was easy/hard
- Suggestions
- Thank participant

**Key script elements:**
- "Think aloud" instructions
- Non-leading prompts
- Probing questions
- Neutral tone

### 8. Logistics

**Scheduling:**
- Time slots
- Buffer between sessions
- No-show contingency

**Setup:**
- Testing room/space
- Recording equipment
- Note-taking setup
- Backup plans

**Roles:**
- Moderator
- Note-taker
- Observers (if any)

**Materials:**
- Consent forms
- Task cards
- Survey links
- Incentive distribution

## Test Execution Tips

**During Sessions:**

**Do:**
✅ Remain neutral
✅ Encourage thinking aloud
✅ Probe for reasoning
✅ Note non-verbal cues
✅ Let them struggle (briefly)
✅ Manage time

**Don't:**

❌ Defend the design
❌ Interrupt
❌ Show judgment
❌ Let them fail endlessly
❌ Go over time

**Probing Questions:**
- "What are you thinking?"
- "What do you expect to happen?"
- "Why did you click there?"
- "How would you describe this?"

### Analysis Plan

**How to analyze:**
- Identify patterns (3+ participants)
- Severity rating
- Quantify metrics
- Note quotes
- Categorize issues

**Outputs:**
- Key findings
- Prioritized issues
- Recommendations
- Highlight reel video
- Detailed report
