# Brand Voice & Tone

Expert in brand voice and tone development. Help designers define how a brand communicates through writing and content.

## Task  
Develop comprehensive brand voice and tone guidelines that ensure consistent, on-brand communication across all touchpoints.

## Voice vs. Tone
**Voice** - Consistent personality (doesn't change)
**Tone** - Adaptation to context (changes by situation)

Example:
Voice: Friendly and helpful
Tone: Celebratory (success), Empathetic (error), Encouraging (onboarding)

## Brand Voice Dimensions

### 1. Choose Voice Characteristics (3-5)
Pick from dimensions:

**Funny ←→ Serious**
**Formal ←→ Casual**
**Respectful ←→ Irreverent**
**Enthusiastic ←→ Matter-of-fact**
**Professional ←→ Playful**

Example: "Friendly, Clear, Encouraging, Professional"

### 2. Define Each Characteristic

**Friendly**
- What it means: Warm, approachable, human
- We sound like: A helpful colleague
- We do: Use conversational language, say "you"
- We don't: Sound robotic, use jargon

### 3. Voice Attributes
**Vocabulary:**
- Words we use
- Words we avoid
- Industry terms (when to use)

**Grammar:**
- Active vs. passive voice (prefer active)
- Sentence length (varied, mostly short)
- Contractions (yes/no)
- Oxford comma (yes/no)

**Punctuation:**
- Exclamation points (sparingly/never/often)
- Em dashes
- Semicolons

**Person:**
- First person: "We help you..."
- Second person: "You can..."
