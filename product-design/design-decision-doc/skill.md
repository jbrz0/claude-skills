# Design Decision Documentation

Expert in documenting design decisions and rationale. Help designers create clear records of decisions that explain the "why" behind design choices.

## Task
Guide creation of decision documentation that captures context, options considered, rationale, and trade-offs for important design choices.

## Why Document Decisions?

**Benefits:**
- Future you remembers why
- Team understands reasoning
- Stakeholders see thought process
- New team members get context
- Prevent revisiting resolved decisions
- Learn from past choices

**When to document:**
- Major design directions
- Controversial decisions
- Trade-offs made
- User research insights
- Technical constraints
- Accessibility choices

# Navigation Structure: Tabs vs. Hamburger Menu

## Context
**Background:**
Mobile app navigation redesign. Current hamburger menu has low discoverability. Analytics show users missing key features.

**Date:** 2024-02-15
**Participants:** Design team, PM, Engineering lead
**Status:** Decided

## Problem
How should we structure primary navigation on mobile to improve feature discoverability while maintaining clean UI?

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Bottom Tab Bar
**Description:** 5 tabs with icons and labels at bottom of screen

**Pros:**
- High discoverability (always visible)
- Industry standard (iOS/Android)
- One-tap access to main sections
- Thumb-friendly zone
- Clear current location

**Cons:**
- Limited to 5 items
- Takes permanent screen space
- Less flexible for future growth

**User Impact:** +Easier navigation, +Faster access, -Slightly less content space
**Effort:** Medium (new component, state management)

### Option 2: Hamburger Menu (Current)
**Description:** Icon in top-left that opens navigation drawer

**Pros:**
- More menu items possible
- Familiar to current users
- Maximum screen space for content

**Cons:**
- Hidden until opened (low discoverability)
- Extra tap required
- Against platform conventions
- Analytics show low usage

**User Impact:** Status quo (poor discoverability)
**Effort:** Low (no change)

### Option 3: Hybrid (Tab + More)
**Description:** 4 tabs for main sections, 5th tab for "More" with additional items

**Pros:**
- Balances discoverability and flexibility
- Room for growth
- Best of both approaches

**Cons:**
- More complex to implement
- "More" section less discoverable
- Deciding what goes where

**User Impact:** +Good discoverability for main items, ±Some items still nested
**Effort:** High (both patterns)

## Decision
**Chosen:** Option 1 - Bottom Tab Bar

**Rationale:**

**User needs:**
- User testing showed 85% preference for tabs over hamburger
- Participants found features 40% faster with tabs
- "I always forget what's in that menu" (4 of 8 participants)

**Research:**
- Nielsen Norman Group study: tabs 2x more discoverable
- Analytics: only 23% of users ever open hamburger menu
- Competitor analysis: 8 of 10 competitors use tabs

**Alignment:**
- Product goal: increase feature adoption
- Tabs directly address discoverability problem
- Aligns with platform conventions (iOS, Material Design)

**Why not hamburger:**
- Current data shows it's not working
- Goes against platform expectations
- Hides features we want to promote

**Why not hybrid:**
- Added complexity not worth incremental benefit
- 5 main sections sufficient for current needs
- Can revisit if we need more sections

## Trade-offs

**Accepting:**
- Limited to 5 primary sections (acceptable: only have 4 critical sections, 5th is profile)
- Permanent screen space used (~56px) (acceptable: benefit outweighs cost)
- Need to be selective about what's primary (acceptable: forces prioritization)

**Not accepting:**
- Poor discoverability (primary goal to fix)
- Platform inconsistency (important for native feel)

## Implementation

**Required:**
- Design: Tab bar component with all states
- Dev: Bottom navigation component, routing
- Content: Icon design for each section, short labels
- Timeline: 2 weeks design, 1 sprint dev

**Success Criteria:**
- Feature discovery increases 50%
- Navigation engagement increases 200%
- Task completion time decreases 30%
- Positive user feedback

**Metrics to track:**
- Tap-through rate on each tab
- Time to key features
- User satisfaction (SUS score)

## Open Questions
- Should we animate tab transitions?
- How to handle notifications across tabs?
- Tablet layout (tabs or sidebar)?

## Best Practices

✅ **Do:**

2. Decision log (all decisions)
3. Design principles (derived from decisions)
4. Decision templates

Begin by identifying important decisions that need documentation and context.
