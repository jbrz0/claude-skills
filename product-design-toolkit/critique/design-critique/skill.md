# Design Critique Facilitation

Expert in facilitating effective design critiques. Help designers run structured, productive critique sessions that provide actionable feedback and improve work.

## Task
Guide designers in planning and facilitating critique sessions that are constructive, focused, and result in clear next steps.

## What is Design Critique?

**Purpose:**
- Get diverse perspectives
- Identify issues early
- Improve the work
- Align the team
- Share knowledge

**Not:**
- Personal preference sharing ("I like blue better")
- Design by committee
- Showing off
- Just positive feedback

## Critique Frameworks

### 1. I Like, I Wish, What If

**I like...** (Positive feedback)
"I like how the navigation is clearly labeled"

**I wish...** (Constructive feedback)
"I wish the CTA stood out more from other elements"

**What if...** (Suggestions)
"What if we tried making the button larger?"

### 2. Rose, Thorn, Bud

**Rose** - What's working well
**Thorn** - What's problematic
**Bud** - Potential opportunities

### 3. Specific Criteria

Review against specific criteria:
- Does it meet user needs?
- Is it accessible?
- Is it on brand?
- Is it feasible?
- Does it solve the problem?

### 4. Question-Based

Structure feedback as questions:
- "How does this help users accomplish X?"
- "What happens when [edge case]?"
- "Have you considered [alternative]?"

## Critique Session Structure

### Before the Critique (Presenter)
**Prepare:**
- Share work 24 hours in advance
- Provide context document
- List specific questions/concerns
- Frame what kind of feedback needed

**Context to provide:**
- Problem being solved
- User needs
- Constraints
- Current stage (early concept vs. final)
- Specific areas for feedback

### During Critique (60 min)

**1. Setup (5 min)**
- Review purpose and format
- Ground rules reminder
- Context overview

**2. Presentation (10-15 min)**
- Designer presents work
- Explains thinking
- Shares specific questions
- No interruptions

**3. Clarifying Questions (5 min)**
- Questions for understanding only
- No feedback yet
- Ensure everyone understands

**4. Silent Review (5 min)**
- Everyone examines work closely
- Takes notes
- Formulates feedback

**5. Structured Feedback (25-30 min)**
- Go around room systematically
- Use chosen framework
- Keep feedback specific
- Focus on the work, not the person
- Presenter listens, doesn't defend

**6. Designer Response (5 min)**
- Designer can ask follow-ups
- Clarify feedback
- No need to justify decisions

**7. Wrap-up (5 min)**
- Summarize key themes
- List action items
- Thank participants

### After Critique
**Presenter:**
- Synthesize feedback
- Prioritize changes
- Update design
- Follow up on questions

**Participants:**
- Share additional thoughts
- Offer to help
- Check in later

## Ground Rules

**Do:**
✅ Focus on the work, not the person
✅ Be specific and actionable
✅ Ask questions to understand
✅ Consider user needs and goals
✅ Reference research or data
✅ Build on others' feedback
✅ Time-box discussions

**Don't:**
❌ Make it personal
❌ Give vague feedback
❌ Just share preferences
❌ Defend your feedback
❌ Dominate the conversation
❌ Redesign on the spot
❌ Assume you know better

## Giving Good Feedback

**Be specific:**
❌ "I don't like it"
✅ "The hierarchy isn't clear - the secondary action looks as important as the primary"

**Be objective:**
❌ "I prefer green"
✅ "Green has stronger association with success in our user testing"

**Be actionable:**
❌ "This doesn't work"
✅ "The button is hard to find - try increasing contrast or size"

**Focus on goals:**
❌ "That's ugly"
✅ "This doesn't align with our professional brand personality"

**Explain reasoning:**
❌ "Make it bigger"
✅ "This needs to be larger to meet minimum 44px touch target for accessibility"

## Receiving Feedback

**As presenter:**
✅ Listen actively
✅ Take notes
✅ Ask clarifying questions
✅ Thank people for feedback
✅ Separate signal from noise

❌ Get defensive
❌ Justify every decision
❌ Take it personally
❌ Implement everything blindly
❌ Dismiss all feedback

**Remember:** Feedback is about improving the work, not judging you.

## Types of Critique Sessions

### 1. Early Concept Review
**Stage:** Sketches, wireframes
**Focus:** Direction, approach, big ideas
**Feedback:** Broad, strategic
**Questions:** "Is this the right direction?" "What are we missing?"

### 2. Design Review
**Stage:** High-fidelity mockups
**Focus:** Execution, details, polish
**Feedback:** Specific, tactical
**Questions:** "Does this work?" "What needs refinement?"

### 3. Stakeholder Review
**Stage:** Near-final
**Focus:** Business alignment, feasibility
**Feedback:** Strategic fit
**Questions:** "Does this meet business goals?" "Can we build this?"

### 4. Accessibility Review
**Stage:** Any stage
**Focus:** Inclusive design
**Feedback:** WCAG compliance, usability
**Questions:** "Is this accessible?" "What barriers exist?"

## Virtual Critique Tips

**Tools:**
- Figma (comment mode)
- Miro/Mural
- Zoom with screen share
- Loom (async feedback)

**Best practices:**
- Use video (see reactions)
- Screen share work
- Use collaborative tools
- Record session
- Follow-up in writing

## Common Challenges

**Challenge:** Too much feedback to action
**Solution:** Prioritize by impact and effort, focus on critical issues

**Challenge:** Conflicting feedback
**Solution:** Look for themes, test with users, make decision and explain

**Challenge:** Dominant voices
**Solution:** Use round-robin, written feedback first, call on quiet people

**Challenge:** Vague feedback
**Solution:** Ask for specifics, examples, or suggestions

**Challenge:** Design by committee
**Solution:** Designer makes final call, feedback informs but doesn't dictate

## Facilitation Tips

**As facilitator:**
- Keep time
- Ensure everyone participates
- Redirect off-topic discussions
- Synthesize themes
- Protect presenter
- Keep it constructive

**Time management:**
- Use timer
- Park tangents
- Move on when needed
- Protect presentation time

## Deliverables
1. Critique session plan
2. Feedback framework
3. Ground rules doc
4. Feedback summary
5. Action items list
