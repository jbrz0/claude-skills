## Gemini-Specific Tips

### Be Direct and Clear
Gemini responds well to straightforward, detailed instructions:

❌ Vague: "cool app design"
✅ Clear: "modern mobile banking app interface showing account balance and recent transactions, 
clean white design with blue accents, displayed on iPhone, professional product photography"

### Specify Context
Gemini handles context well:

✅ "laptop on desk in modern office"
✅ "phone held in hand against blurred background"
✅ "tablet displayed at 45-degree angle on white surface"

### Use Photography Terms
Gemini understands photographic concepts:

- depth of field (shallow/deep)
- perspective (isometric, aerial, eye-level)
- focal length implications
- lighting setups

### Request Text in Images
Gemini can handle text better than some other generators:

```
Marketing poster with bold headline "LAUNCH 2024" in modern sans-serif font, 
colorful gradient background, tech aesthetic, professional graphic design
```

### Multiple Objects
Clearly specify relationships:

```
Three smartphones arranged in a row, each displaying different screens of the same app, 
all in same lighting, consistent perspective, professional product photography
```

## Common Modifications & Iterations

### If image is too busy:
Add: "minimalist", "clean", "simple", "uncluttered"

### If not photorealistic enough:
Add: "photorealistic", "professional photography", "high quality camera", "realistic textures"

### If lighting is off:
Specify: "soft natural lighting", "studio lighting", "even lighting", "no harsh shadows"

### If composition needs adjustment:
Specify: "centered", "rule of thirds", "overhead view", "specific angle"

### If colors are wrong:
Specify exact colors or palettes: "blue #0066CC and white only", "muted pastel palette"

## Quality Enhancers

Add these for better results:

**For photorealism:**
- "professional photography"
- "shot on high-end camera"
- "realistic lighting"
- "accurate proportions"
- "detailed textures"

**For clarity:**
- "sharp focus"
- "high resolution"
- "crisp details"
- "well-defined"
- "clear"

**For professional look:**
- "commercial photography"
- "advertising quality"
- "professional product shot"
- "studio quality"
- "polished"

## Aspect Ratios

Specify when needed:
- Square (1:1) - Social posts, profiles
- Portrait (9:16) - Mobile screens, stories
- Landscape (16:9) - Desktop, presentations, hero images
- Wide (21:9) - Cinematic, wide banners

## Negative Guidance

What to avoid (mention if appearing unwanted):
- "no text" (if you don't want text)
- "no people" (if you want product only)
- "no watermarks"
- "not cluttered"
- "not dark"

## Iteration Strategy

1. **Start with core prompt:**
   Subject + context + style
   
2. **Generate and evaluate:**
   What's right? What's wrong?

3. **Refine with specifics:**
   Add details about what's missing
   
4. **Adjust style/mood:**
   Modify lighting, composition, or aesthetic
   
5. **Polish:**
   Add quality enhancers
   Fine-tune specific elements

## Examples: Before & After

### Before (vague):
"app on phone"

### After (specific):
"iPhone 14 displaying a modern fitness tracking app interface with workout statistics, 
clean white and blue design, held in hand against soft gray background, 
natural lighting, professional product photography, centered composition, high quality"

---

### Before (too complex):
"amazing futuristic app design with lots of cool features and animations in space"

### After (focused):
"sleek dark-mode mobile app interface showing data dashboard with glowing blue charts, 
modern sci-fi aesthetic, displayed on smartphone, floating against dark gradient background, 
subtle light effects, professional visualization, high-tech feel"

## Best Practices

✅ **Do:**
- Be specific and descriptive
- Use clear, straightforward language
