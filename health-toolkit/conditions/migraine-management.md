# Migraine Management

Expert in migraine prevention, trigger identification, and treatment optimization. Help reduce migraine frequency, severity, and duration through systematic tracking, lifestyle modifications, and evidence-based interventions.

## Core Principles

**Migraines are a neurological disease**
- Not "just a headache"
- Genetic component (60-70% hereditary)
- Brain hyperexcitability disorder
- Requires systematic management

**Prevention beats treatment**
- Reducing triggers more effective than treating attacks
- Consistent lifestyle > reactive medication
- Track patterns to identify personal triggers
- Small changes compound over time

**Everyone's triggers are different**
- Common triggers, but individual patterns
- What works for others may not work for you
- Systematic tracking reveals your patterns
- Requires experimentation and patience

**Goal:** Reduce migraine frequency and severity through personalized prevention strategies

## Understanding Migraines

### Types of migraines:

**Migraine without aura (most common):**
```
Symptoms:
- Moderate to severe throbbing pain
- Usually one-sided (but not always)
- 4-72 hours duration
- Worsened by physical activity
- Nausea/vomiting
- Light and sound sensitivity

Frequency: 60-70% of migraine sufferers
```

**Migraine with aura:**
```
Aura (occurs before headache):
- Visual disturbances (most common)
  - Zigzag lines, blind spots, flashing lights
- Sensory changes (numbness, tingling)
- Speech difficulties
- Usually 20-60 minutes duration

Then: Headache phase follows (or sometimes doesn't)

Frequency: 25-30% of migraine sufferers
Can alternate with migraine without aura
```

**Chronic migraine:**
```
Definition: 15+ headache days/month
8+ of those must be migraine

Often develops from episodic migraine
Requires different treatment approach
Medication overuse is common factor
```

**Other types:**
```
Hemiplegic migraine: Temporary paralysis on one side
Vestibular migraine: Vertigo, dizziness
Retinal migraine: Temporary vision loss in one eye
Menstrual migraine: Tied to hormone cycle

Rare but important to identify (different management)
```

### Migraine phases:

**Prodrome (hours to days before):**
```
Early warning signs:
- Mood changes (irritability, depression, euphoria)
- Food cravings (especially salt or sweets)
- Neck stiffness
- Increased urination
- Yawning
- Fatigue

Important: Recognizing prodrome allows early intervention
Treating during prodrome = better response
```

**Aura (if present, 20-60 minutes):**
```
Visual, sensory, or speech disturbances
Often first sign you'll notice
Use this time to take medication
Get to quiet, dark room
```

**Headache phase (4-72 hours):**
```
The main attack
Moderate to severe pain
Nausea, vomiting
Light/sound sensitivity
Need to lie down in dark room

First 2 hours: Best window for medication
After that: Harder to stop the cascade
```

**Postdrome (hours to days after):**
```
The "migraine hangover"
- Fatigue, weakness
- Difficulty concentrating
- Mood changes
- Muscle aches

Many people feel "wiped out" for 1-2 days
Not just in your head, real neurological recovery
```

## Common Triggers

### Food triggers:

**High tyramine foods:**
```
What: Amino acid that affects blood vessels
Where: Aged/fermented foods

Common sources:
- Aged cheeses (cheddar, blue, parmesan)
- Cured meats (salami, pepperoni, hot dogs)
- Soy sauce, miso
- Pickled foods
- Overripe bananas

Fresh = better than aged
Individual variation high
```

**Alcohol:**
```
Red wine: Most common trigger
- Contains tannins, histamines, tyramine
- Sulfites may contribute

Other alcohol: Can trigger in some people
- Dehydration component
- Vasodilation effect

Pattern: Often delayed (next day headache)
Threshold: May tolerate small amounts
```

**Caffeine:**
```
Paradox: Can help AND trigger

Helpful:
- Vasoconstriction effect
- Enhances pain medication
- Many use coffee to abort migraine

Trigger:
- Withdrawal if regular user (weekend headaches)
- Too much caffeine (rebound)
- Inconsistent intake

Solution: Consistent daily dose or zero
Avoid fluctuations (weekday coffee → weekend none)
```

**MSG and artificial sweeteners:**
```
MSG (monosodium glutamate):
- In many processed foods
- Chinese food, chips, instant noodles
- "Natural flavoring" often contains MSG

Aspartame (diet soda, sugar-free products):
- Strong trigger for many people
- Metabolizes to phenylalanine (can affect neurotransmitters)

Controversial: Studies mixed, but many people report effects
Worth eliminating if suspect trigger
```

**Skipping meals:**
```
Blood sugar drops = common trigger
- Hypoglycemia affects brain
- Stress response triggered
- Hormone fluctuations

Prevention:
- Regular meal timing (same times daily)
- Balanced meals with protein
- Small snacks between meals if needed
- Never skip breakfast
```

### Lifestyle triggers:

**Sleep irregularity:**
```
Too little sleep: Major trigger
- <7 hours consistently problematic
- Sleep debt accumulates

Too much sleep: Also a trigger
- Sleeping in on weekends = common pattern
- Blood sugar/caffeine timing affected

Irregular schedule: Worst
- Shift work particularly bad
- Weekend sleep schedule changes

Solution: Consistent sleep/wake time every day
Even weekends (sucks but works)
```

**Stress:**
```
During stress: Body is resilient
After stress relaxes: "Weekend migraine"
- Cortisol drops
- Neurotransmitter shifts
- Blood vessel changes

Pattern: Friday evening, Saturday migraine
Also: Post-deadline, after exams, vacation start

Management: Regular stress reduction practices
Not just managing stress spikes
```

**Physical activity changes:**
```
Overexertion: Sudden intense exercise
- Blood vessel dilation
- Dehydration
- Blood sugar drops

Lack of exercise: Also problematic
- Deconditioning
- Stress accumulation

Solution: Regular, moderate exercise
Gradual progression
Proper warmup/cooldown
```

**Dehydration:**
```
Even mild dehydration can trigger
- Brain slightly shrinks, pulls on membranes
- Blood volume decreases
- Electrolyte imbalances

Signs: Thirst, dark urine, fatigue

Prevention:
- Consistent water intake throughout day
- More in heat, with exercise
- 8+ glasses typically recommended
- Electrolytes if sweating heavily
```

### Environmental triggers:

**Light:**
```
Bright light: Direct trigger
- Sunlight, fluorescent lights
- Computer screens (blue light)
- Flickering lights

Mechanism: Overactivates visual cortex
Photophobia during migraine = symptom and trigger

Prevention:
- Sunglasses outdoors (polarized)
- Screen brightness adjustment
- Blue light filters (f.lux, Night Shift)
- Breaks from screens
- Avoid fluorescent lighting if possible
```

**Weather changes:**
```
Barometric pressure: Major trigger for many
- Pressure drops (storms coming)
- Rapid changes worse than gradual

Other weather factors:
- Temperature extremes
- High humidity
- Strong winds

Problem: Can't control weather
Solution: Track correlation, plan accordingly
Prophylactic medication on forecast bad days
```

**Strong smells:**
```
Perfume, cologne, air fresheners
Cigarette smoke
Gasoline, paint, cleaning products
Strong food smells

Mechanism: Olfactory system hypersensitivity

Avoidance:
- Request fragrance-free environments
- Open windows for ventilation
- Avoid perfume sections in stores
```

**Noise:**
```
Loud noises: Concert, construction, traffic
Repetitive sounds: Dripping, beeping, ticking
Sudden noises: Alarms, crashes

During migraine: Extreme sound sensitivity

Prevention:
- Noise-canceling headphones
- White noise to mask sounds
- Quiet spaces for work/sleep
```

### Hormonal triggers (women):

**Menstrual cycle:**
```
Most common pattern: Drop in estrogen
- 2 days before period
- First 3 days of period

"Menstrual migraine":
- Predictable timing
- Often more severe
- Harder to treat

Management:
- Track cycle relationship
- Preventive medication around period
- Extended cycle birth control (fewer periods)
- Magnesium supplementation
```

**Birth control:**
```
Combined pills (estrogen + progestin):
- Can improve or worsen migraines
- Estrogen fluctuation is issue
- Progestin-only better for many

Pattern changes:
- Placebo week = estrogen drop = migraine
- Some do better skipping placebo week
- Some need to avoid hormonal BC entirely

Migraine with aura + estrogen BC = stroke risk
Discuss with doctor
```

**Pregnancy and menopause:**
```
Pregnancy: Many improve (especially 2nd/3rd trimester)
- Stable high estrogen
- Can worsen 1st trimester or postpartum

Menopause: Variable
- Perimenopause often worse (fluctuations)
- Post-menopause often better (stability)
- HRT decisions complex

Always work with doctor for hormonal triggers
```

## Trigger Tracking System

### Why tracking matters:

**Without tracking:**
```
"I get migraines sometimes"
- Can't identify patterns
- Can't avoid triggers
- Can't communicate effectively with doctor
- Feel helpless

Triggers are often cumulative (threshold effect)
One trigger alone = fine
Two together = migraine
```

**With tracking:**
```
"I get migraines when I sleep in on weekends after having wine Friday night"
- Specific, actionable pattern
- Can test hypotheses
- Can make targeted changes
- Empowering

Data beats guessing
Patterns emerge over 2-3 months
```

### What to track:

**Migraine details:**
```
Date and time:
- When started (include time of day)
- How long lasted
- When noticed prodrome (if applicable)

Severity: 1-10 scale
- 1-3: Mild (annoying but functional)
- 4-6: Moderate (need to stop activities)
- 7-9: Severe (debilitating, dark room)
- 10: Worst pain imaginable, ER-level

Location: Left, right, both sides, front, back

Symptoms:
- Nausea, vomiting
- Light sensitivity
- Sound sensitivity
- Aura (if present, describe)
- Other symptoms
```

**Potential triggers (24-48 hours before):**
```
Sleep:
- Hours slept
- Quality (1-10)
- Time to bed, time woke up
- Sleep consistency vs usual schedule

Food/drink:
- Meals (what and when)
- Skipped meals?
- Alcohol (type, amount)
- Caffeine (amount, timing vs usual)
- Water intake

Stress/activity:
- Major stressors
- Exercise (type, intensity, duration)
- Relaxation after stress period

Environment:
- Weather changes (check barometric pressure)
- Strong smells
- Bright lights
- Loud environments

Hormones (if applicable):
- Day of cycle
- Birth control changes
- Hormone therapy
```

**Treatment:**
```
What you took:
- Medication (name, dose, timing)
- How soon after onset
- Effectiveness (did it work?)
- Side effects

Non-medication interventions:
- Ice/heat
- Dark room rest
- Sleep
- Hydration
- Other techniques
```

### Tracking methods:

**Simple: Spreadsheet or journal**
```
Columns: Date | Time | Severity | Duration | Triggers | Treatment | Effectiveness

Pros: Free, flexible, simple
Cons: Manual, requires discipline

Good for: Starting out, simple tracking
```

**Apps:**
```
Migraine Buddy (popular, comprehensive)
- Detailed tracking
- Reports for doctor
- Pattern identification
- Free with premium option

Migraine Coach (good alternative)
- Similar features
- Different interface

N1-Headache (simple)
- Quick logging
- Minimal friction

Choose based on preference for detail vs speed
```

**Advanced: Quantified self approach**
```
Cross-reference with:
- Sleep tracker (Oura, Whoop)
- Weather app (barometric pressure)
- Food diary
- Fitness tracker
- Stress measures

Requires more effort, but best patterns
Good if you're data-driven
```

### Analyzing patterns:

**Look for:**
```
Time patterns:
- Same day each week? (weekend migraine)
- Same time each month? (hormonal)
- Same time of day? (blood sugar, caffeine)

Food patterns:
- Always after certain food?
- Skipped meals?
- Alcohol the day before?

Lifestyle patterns:
- After late nights?
- After intense exercise?
- During/after stress?

Environmental patterns:
- Weather changes?
- Seasonal?
- Location-specific?

Combination triggers:
- Maybe not one thing, but two together
- Example: Wine + late sleep = migraine
- Neither alone triggers, combination does
```

**After 2-3 months:**
```
You should see patterns emerging
Bring data to doctor appointment
Test hypotheses by eliminating suspected triggers
Track changes after eliminations

This is how you gain control
```

## Prevention Strategies

### Lifestyle modifications:

**Sleep consistency (most important):**
```
Same bedtime/wake time every day:
- Weekdays AND weekends
- Within 30-minute window
- Yes, even if you're tired
- Yes, even if you want to sleep in

Why it works:
- Stabilizes circadian rhythm
- Prevents caffeine/blood sugar timing shifts
- Reduces stress hormone fluctuations

Implementation:
- Choose realistic times (can actually maintain)
- Gradual adjustments (15 min shifts if needed)
- Use alarms for both bedtime and wake time
- No snooze button

Hard but effective
Most people see improvement in 2-4 weeks
```

**Regular meal timing:**
```
Eat at consistent times:
- Breakfast within 1 hour of waking
- Lunch same time daily (±30 min)
- Dinner same time daily
- Snacks if needed (also consistent timing)

Blood sugar stability:
- Never go >4-5 hours without eating (while awake)
- Balanced meals (protein + complex carbs + fat)
- Avoid simple sugars alone

Plan ahead:
- Prep meals/snacks
- Keep emergency snacks available
- Don't skip meals for convenience

Boring but works
```

**Hydration protocol:**
```
Amount: 8-10 glasses (64-80oz) minimum
- More if exercising, hot weather
- Spread throughout day (not all at once)

Consistency:
- Start day with water
- Glass with each meal
- Bottle at desk/with you
- Finish by evening (avoid nighttime bathroom trips)

Check: Urine should be pale yellow
Dark = dehydrated (common trigger)

Electrolytes:
- If sweating heavily, add electrolytes
- Salt food adequately
- Magnesium supplement helps
```

**Stress management:**
```
Not "avoid stress" (impossible)
But: Regular stress reduction practices

Daily practices:
- 10-20 minutes meditation/breathing
- Regular exercise (moderate, not intense)
- Time in nature
- Hobbies, creative activities

Prevent "crash" pattern:
- Don't wait for vacation to relax
- Mini-breaks during intense periods
- Stress inoculation (small regular stressors)

Transition rituals:
- After work: Decompression routine
- Before bed: Wind-down ritual
- After stressful events: Active recovery

Build resilience, don't just react
```

**Exercise routine:**
```
Moderate, regular exercise best:
- 3-5x per week
- 30-45 minutes
- Conversational pace (not maxing out)
- Consistent schedule

Good options:
- Walking, jogging
- Swimming, cycling
- Yoga (gentle, not hot)
- Strength training (moderate)

Avoid:
- Intense HIIT if it triggers you
- Overexertion
- Inconsistent patterns (sedentary → sudden intense)

Proper fueling:
- Eat before exercise
- Hydrate well
- Post-workout nutrition
- Adequate recovery

Exercise helps many, but listen to body
Some people need gentler approach
```

### Dietary approach:

**Elimination testing:**
```
Don't eliminate everything at once
Test one category at a time (4-6 weeks each)

Common elimination order:
1. Alcohol (especially red wine)
2. Aged cheeses
3. Processed meats
4. MSG/artificial sweeteners
5. Chocolate
6. Nuts

Process:
- Eliminate completely for 4-6 weeks
- Track migraine frequency/severity
- Reintroduce intentionally (test)
- If migraine occurs after reintroduction = likely trigger
- Document findings

Keep diet otherwise normal during testing
```

**Low-tyramine diet:**
```
If food triggers suspected:

Avoid:
- Aged cheeses (fresh cheese OK)
- Cured/smoked meats
- Fermented foods (soy sauce, miso, kimchi)
- Overripe fruits
- Certain nuts (especially peanuts)
- Alcohol (especially red wine)

Eat:
- Fresh foods
- Young cheeses (cream cheese, cottage cheese)
- Fresh meat/poultry/fish
- Most vegetables
- Fresh fruits
- Whole grains

Food freshness matters:
- Leftovers increase tyramine as they age
- Freeze extras rather than refrigerate for days
- Eat prepared food soon after cooking
```

**Magnesium supplementation:**
```
Dose: 400-600mg daily (magnesium glycinate or oxide)
Timing: With dinner or bedtime

Why it helps:
- Many migraine sufferers deficient
- Reduces neuronal hyperexcitability
- Improves sleep quality
- Relaxes blood vessels

Evidence: Good support for prevention
Safe, low side effects (diarrhea at high dose)

Give it 3 months to see effects
Not acute treatment, prevention only
```

**Riboflavin (B2) supplementation:**
```
Dose: 400mg daily
Timing: Morning with food

Why it helps:
- Improves mitochondrial function
- Reduces oxidative stress in brain
- Takes 2-3 months to work

Evidence: Good studies for prevention
Very safe, almost no side effects
Urine turns bright yellow (harmless)

Cost effective option
```

**Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10):**
```
Dose: 100-300mg daily
Timing: With food (fat-soluble)

Why it helps:
- Mitochondrial energy production
- Antioxidant effects
- Reduces frequency in studies

Evidence: Moderate support
Safe, expensive vs other supplements

Optional but worth trying if others don't help
```

### Environmental control:

**Light management:**
```
Indoors:
- Dim overhead lights
- Task lighting instead
- Blue light filters on screens (f.lux, Night Shift)
- Break from screens every 20 minutes (20-20-20 rule)
- Avoid fluorescent lights if possible

Outdoors:
- Polarized sunglasses always
- Wide-brimmed hat
- Seek shade
- Gradual light adjustments (don't go from dark to bright suddenly)

Bedroom:
- Blackout curtains
- No light from electronics
- Red light for nighttime if needed

Photophobia during migraine = darkest room possible
```

**Temperature and pressure:**
```
Keep environment stable:
- Avoid extreme temperatures
- Gradual temperature changes (layer clothing)
- Air conditioning in summer (stable temp)
- Humidifier in winter (if air dry)

Weather tracking:
- Monitor barometric pressure (weather apps)
- Plan accordingly on high-trigger days
- Prophylactic medication if needed

Can't control weather, but can prepare
```

**Noise control:**
```
Reduce exposure:
- Quiet work environment
- Noise-canceling headphones
- White noise to mask irregular sounds
- Avoid loud venues (concerts, bars, clubs)

During migraine:
- Silent room
- Earplugs
- White noise machine (paradoxically helps some)

Create quiet spaces in home/work
```

---

## Acute Treatment

### Medication options:

**Over-the-counter (first-line):**
```
NSAIDs:
- Ibuprofen: 400-800mg at onset
- Naproxen: 500-1000mg at onset
- Best: Taken early (during prodrome or aura)

Aspirin: 900-1000mg
- Often combined with acetaminophen + caffeine
- Excedrin Migraine (aspirin 250mg + acetaminophen 250mg + caffeine 65mg)

Acetaminophen: 1000mg
- Less effective alone
- Better in combination

Timing critical: Take within first 2 hours
After that, cascade harder to stop
Don't wait to see if it gets worse
```

**Combination approach:**
```
Many respond better to combinations:

Example 1:
- Ibuprofen 600mg
- Acetaminophen 1000mg
- Caffeine (coffee or caffeine pill)

Example 2:
- Excedrin Migraine (already combined)
- Extra ibuprofen if severe

Add anti-nausea:
- Ginger tea
- Ginger chews
- Dramamine if severe

Dark room + ice pack + sleep
This combination aborts many migraines
```

**Warning: Medication overuse headache (MOH):**
```
Problem: Taking pain medication >2-3 days/week
Result: Rebound headaches, increased frequency

Culprits:
- Acetaminophen, ibuprofen, aspirin
- Combination medications (especially with caffeine)
- Triptans
- Opioids (worst)

Threshold: >10-15 days/month medication use
Creates cycle: More headaches → more medication → more headaches

If you're at this threshold: Need doctor help
May need to break cycle with bridge therapy
Focus shifts to prevention
```

**Triptans (prescription):**
```
Most common: Sumatriptan (Imitrex)
Others: Rizatriptan, Eletriptan, Zolmitriptan, etc.

Mechanism: Serotonin agonist, stops migraine cascade

Forms:
- Tablets (most common)
- Nasal spray (faster)
- Injection (fastest, most effective)

Dosing:
- Sumatriptan: 50-100mg tablet, can repeat once after 2 hours
- Other triptans: Similar protocols, different dosing

Response: Usually within 2 hours if effective
If one triptan doesn't work, another might
Not everyone responds

Timing: Take during aura or early headache phase
Too late = less effective

Contraindications:
- Heart disease, stroke risk, uncontrolled high blood pressure
- Hemiplegic or basilar migraine
- Pregnancy

Side effects:
- Chest tightness (not dangerous but scary)
- Dizziness, fatigue
- Injection site pain (if injectable)

Cost: Generic available now (cheap)
Limits: Often restricted to 9 doses/month by insurance
```

**CGRP antagonists (newer, prescription):**
```
Ubrogepant (Ubrelvy)
Rimegepant (Nurtec ODT)

Mechanism: Blocks CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide)
Different pathway than triptans

Advantages:
- Can use with cardiovascular disease (no vessel constriction)
- Can use with hemiplegic migraine
- May work when triptans don't
- Fewer side effects
- Rimegepant also approved for prevention

Disadvantages:
- Expensive (no generic yet)
- Insurance may require triptan failure first
- Less long-term data

Future: This class is evolving rapidly
```

**Anti-nausea medications:**
```
Ondansetron (Zofran): 4-8mg
- Very effective for nausea
- Dissolving tablets available
- Prescription

Metoclopramide (Reglan): 10mg
- Anti-nausea + promotility
- Can help medication absorption
- Prescription
- Some people get side effects (restlessness)

Prochlorperazine (Compazine): 10mg
- Anti-nausea + sedation
- Good if you need to sleep through migraine
- Prescription

OTC: Ginger, Dramamine (less effective but accessible)

Important: Nausea makes migraine worse
Treating nausea helps even if doesn't stop headache
```

### Non-medication approaches:

**Ice and heat:**
```
Ice pack:
- Back of neck, base of skull
- Forehead
- 15-20 minutes on, break, repeat
- Numbs pain, constricts blood vessels

Heat: Less common for migraine, but some prefer
- Can help if neck tension component
- Warm shower can help some people

Individual preference varies
Try both, see what works
```

**Dark, quiet room:**
```
Light and sound sensitivity = part of migraine
Reducing stimulation helps recovery

Setup:
- Blackout curtains or eye mask
- Earplugs or white noise
- Cool temperature
- Lie down (even if can't sleep)

This isn't giving up, it's treatment
Brain needs reduced stimulation to recover
```

**Sleep:**
```
Many people sleep through migraines
- Natural recovery mechanism
- Brain can reset
- Often wake up improved or resolved

Challenge: Pain makes sleep hard
Solutions:
- Medication first, then sleep
- Anti-nausea helps
- Dark, quiet room setup
- Don't fight it, embrace it

Afternoon nap might be needed
That's OK, it's treatment
```

**Caffeine (careful use):**
```
Can help abort migraine:
- Vasoconstriction effect
- Enhances pain medication
- Many people use coffee + ibuprofen

Dose: 100-200mg (1-2 cups coffee)

Warning:
- Don't overuse (rebound risk)
- Not effective if you're a heavy caffeine user already
- Timing matters (early in attack)

Paradox: Helps acute treatment but can be trigger
Consistent moderate use OK
Inconsistent use problematic
```

**Pressure points and massage:**
```
Some people find relief:
- Temples (gentle circular pressure)
- Base of skull (suboccipital muscles)
- Between thumb and index finger
- Jaw muscles (if clenching)

Not going to stop migraine alone
But can reduce discomfort
Gentle, not aggressive pressure
```

**Breathing exercises:**
```
Slow, deep breathing:
- 4 seconds in, 6 seconds out
- Focus on belly breathing
- Activates parasympathetic nervous system

Helps with:
- Nausea
- Anxiety (makes migraine worse)
- Pain perception

Not a cure, but adjunct tool
```

---

## Preventive Medication

### When to consider:

**Frequency threshold:**
```
Generally recommended if:
- 4+ migraines per month
- 8+ headache days per month
- Significant disability (missing work/life)
- Acute medications not effective
- Contraindications to acute treatments

Discuss with doctor
Prevention changes the game for many
```

**Goal of prevention:**
```
Not zero migraines (usually unrealistic)
But: 50% reduction considered success

From: 8 migraines/month
To: 4 migraines/month

Huge quality of life improvement
Less acute medication needed
Reduced disability
```

### Common preventive medications:

**Beta-blockers:**
```
Propranolol: 80-240mg daily
Metoprolol: 100-200mg daily

Mechanism: Reduces blood vessel reactivity

Good for:
- People with high blood pressure
- Anxiety component
- Good evidence for migraine prevention

Side effects:
- Fatigue, low blood pressure
- Can affect exercise tolerance
- Vivid dreams
- Not for asthmatics

Often first-line choice
Cheap, generic available
```

**Antidepressants:**
```
Amitriptyline: 10-150mg at bedtime
Nortriptyline: 25-150mg at bedtime

Mechanism: Affects serotonin/norepinephrine, pain perception

Good for:
- People with depression/anxiety
- Chronic pain
- Sleep issues

Side effects:
- Dry mouth, constipation
- Weight gain
- Drowsiness (why taken at night)

Often effective at low dose
Can take 4-8 weeks to work
```

**Anticonvulsants:**
```
Topiramate (Topamax): 50-200mg daily
Valproic acid (Depakote): 500-1500mg daily

Mechanism: Stabilizes neuronal excitability

Good for:
- High-frequency migraines
- Good evidence for prevention

Side effects:
- Topiramate: Tingling, weight loss, cognitive ("Dopamax"), kidney stones
- Valproate: Weight gain, hair loss, liver effects

Topiramate: Many people hate it (side effects)
But: Can be very effective if tolerated

Warning: Both are teratogens (avoid in pregnancy)
```

**CGRP monoclonal antibodies (newest):**
```
Erenumab (Aimovig): Injection monthly
Fremanezumab (Ajovy): Injection monthly or quarterly
Galcanezumab (Emgality): Injection monthly
Eptinezumab (Vyepti): IV infusion quarterly

Mechanism: Block CGRP pathway (migraine-specific)

Advantages:
- Designed specifically for migraine
- Minimal side effects
- Don't have to take daily pill
- Work for many people who failed other preventives

Disadvantages:
- Expensive ($600-700/month without insurance)
- Injectable (but easy, at home)
- Insurance often requires trying other preventives first

Game-changer for many chronic migraine sufferers
If you have access, worth trying
```

**Botox (for chronic migraine only):**
```
Onabotulinumtoxin A (Botox)

Criteria: 15+ headache days/month (chronic migraine)
Dose: 155 units, 31 injections around head/neck
Frequency: Every 12 weeks

Mechanism: Blocks pain signaling, muscle tension

Evidence: Good for chronic migraine specifically
Not for episodic migraine

Process:
- Done by neurologist or headache specialist
- Takes 2-3 treatment cycles to see full effect
- Insurance usually requires failing 2+ oral preventives

Many chronic migraine patients swear by this
Significant reduction in headache days
```

### Preventive strategy:

**Start one at a time:**
```
Don't stack preventives immediately
- Start one medication
- Titrate to effective dose (gradual increase)
- Give it 2-3 months to work
- Assess effectiveness
- If insufficient, add or switch

This way you know what works/causes side effects
```

**Track effectiveness:**
```
Keep migraine diary throughout
Compare:
- Frequency (migraines per month)
- Severity (average pain level)
- Disability (days missed work/activities)
- Acute medication use

Success = 50%+ reduction in any measure
Realistic expectations important
```

**Combination approach:**
```
Sometimes need multiple preventives:
- Example: Propranolol + magnesium + CoQ10
- Example: Botox + CGRP antibody + lifestyle

Work with headache specialist for complex cases
```

---

## Special Situations

### Menstrual migraine:

**Patterns:**
```
Perimenstrual: Days -2 to +3 of cycle
Most common pattern (estrogen drop)

Often more severe than other migraines
Longer lasting
Harder to treat
More disability
```

**Treatment approaches:**
```
Acute: Same as other migraines
But: Take early, aggressive treatment

Short-term prevention:
- NSAIDs starting 2 days before period
- Triptans daily for 5-6 days around period
- "Mini-prevention" just for high-risk days

Hormonal approaches:
- Extended cycle birth control (fewer periods)
- Estrogen supplementation during placebo week
- Continuous birth control (skip placebo weeks)
- Progestin-only birth control

Work with gynecologist + neurologist
Hormonal manipulation can be very effective
```

### Migraine in pregnancy:

**Changes during pregnancy:**
```
Often improve: Especially 2nd and 3rd trimester
- Stable high estrogen
- Many women go months without migraine

Can worsen: 1st trimester, postpartum
- Fluctuating hormones
- Stress, sleep disruption

Pattern: Varies individually
```

**Treatment limitations:**
```
Avoid:
- Most preventive medications (teratogens)
- Triptans (not recommended)
- NSAIDs (especially 3rd trimester)
- Aspirin (high dose)
- Ergotamines

OK options:
- Acetaminophen (Tylenol)
- Magnesium supplementation
- Riboflavin
- Lifestyle modifications
- Cold packs, rest

Severe cases: Consult MFM specialist
Some medications can be used if benefit > risk
```

### Migraine with aura and stroke risk:

**Increased stroke risk:**
```
Migraine with aura + estrogen birth control = contraindicated
Stroke risk increases significantly

Risk factors that compound:
- Smoking
- Age >35
- High blood pressure
- Clotting disorders

If you have migraine with aura:
- Discuss with doctor before starting birth control
- May need progestin-only methods
- Avoid smoking absolutely
```

### Chronic migraine:

**Definition:**
```
15+ headache days per month
8+ must meet migraine criteria
For >3 months

Often evolves from episodic migraine
Medication overuse often involved
More disability than episodic
```

**Treatment approach:**
```
Different than episodic:
- Prevention is primary focus
- Aggressive acute treatment breaks rebound cycle
- May need to withdraw from overused medications
- Botox, CGRP antibodies often used
- Lifestyle modifications critical

Usually requires headache specialist
More complex management
```

## Working with Healthcare

### When to see a doctor:

**Initial diagnosis:**
```
If you think you have migraines:
- See primary care doctor first
- They can often diagnose and start treatment
- Diary data helps

Typical diagnosis based on:
- Symptom pattern
- Migraine criteria met
- Rule out other causes (usually no imaging needed)
```

**When to see specialist (neurologist/headache specialist):**
```
Indications:
- Frequent migraines (4+ per month)
- Poor response to initial treatments
- Uncertain diagnosis
- Complicated migraine (hemiplegic, basilar, etc.)
- Chronic migraine
- Migraine with aura + cardiovascular concerns

Headache specialist = neurologist with extra training
Best for refractory cases
```

**Red flags (ER or urgent care):**
```
"Thunderclap" headache: Sudden, severe, worst ever
- Could be hemorrhage, aneurysm

Headache with:
- Fever, stiff neck (meningitis?)
- Confusion, altered consciousness
- Vision loss
- Weakness, numbness
- Seizure
- Head injury

First aura ever after age 50

Rapidly worsening pattern

These are NOT migraine until proven otherwise
Need imaging, workup
```

### Preparing for appointments:

**Bring migraine diary:**
```
At least 2-3 months of data
Include:
- Frequency (days per month)
- Severity ratings
- Duration
- Triggers noted
- Treatments tried
- Current medications/supplements

This data drives treatment decisions
```

**Questions to ask:**
```
Diagnosis:
- Is this definitely migraine, or could it be something else?
- What type of migraine do I have?

Treatment:
- What's the best first-line treatment for me?
- When should I take acute medications?
- Am I a candidate for preventive medication?
- What are realistic expectations?

Lifestyle:
- What lifestyle changes would help most?
- Are there triggers I'm missing?

Follow-up:
- How long until we expect to see improvement?
- When should I follow up?
- What would make you want to change the plan?
```

**Be honest:**
```
About:
- Medication overuse
- Alcohol/drug use
- Mental health
- Compliance challenges
- Treatment preferences

Doctor can't help if they don't have full picture
No judgment, they've seen everything
```

## Advanced Topics

### Migraine variants:

**Vestibular migraine:**
```
Symptoms: Vertigo, dizziness, imbalance
With or without headache

Triggers: Similar to regular migraine
Treatment: Similar preventives, vestibular therapy

Often underdiagnosed
Many bounced around to ENT, etc.
```

**Abdominal migraine:**
```
More common in children
Symptoms: Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting
Often evolves into typical migraine in adolescence

Treatment: Similar approaches to migraine
```

**Hemiplegic migraine:**
```
Aura includes weakness on one side (like stroke)
Can be scary, but temporary
Genetic form exists (familial hemiplegic migraine)

Treatment: Different (avoid triptans, some others)
Needs specialist management
```

### Comorbidities:

**Depression and anxiety:**
```
2-3x more common in migraine sufferers
Bidirectional relationship (each worsens other)

Treatment:
- Address both conditions
- Some medications help both (amitriptyline, SNRIs)
- Therapy (CBT effective for both)
- Stress management critical
```

**Sleep disorders:**
```
Sleep apnea: Worsens migraines
Insomnia: Common comorbidity

Treatment:
- Sleep study if snoring, daytime sleepiness
- CPAP can dramatically reduce migraines
- Good sleep hygiene essential
```

**TMJ and neck issues:**
```
Jaw clenching/grinding common
Neck tension can trigger migraines

Treatment:
- Night guard for grinding
- Physical therapy
- Posture correction
- Massage, stretching
```

### Research and future treatments:

**CGRP drugs expanding:**
```
More options coming
Oral CGRP antagonists (gepants)
Different mechanisms being tested

This is an active area
More options = better personalization
```

**Neuromodulation devices:**
```
Non-invasive devices:
- Cefaly (electrodes on forehead)
- Gammacore (vagus nerve stimulation)
- Nerivio (remote electrical neuromodulation)

Evidence: Mixed but promising for some people
Expensive, insurance coverage varies
Drug-free option

Worth considering if medications not tolerated
```

**Dietary approaches:**
```
Ketogenic diet: Some evidence for migraine prevention
- Very restrictive
- May work via metabolic changes

Elimination diets: Individualized
- Some people respond dramatically
- Others see no change

More research needed
But diet clearly matters for many
```

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Waiting too long to treat

```
Problem: "I'll see if it gets worse"
Result: Cascade progresses, medications less effective

Fix:
- Treat early (prodrome or aura best)
- First 2 hours critical window
- Don't wait and hope

Early treatment = better outcomes
```

### Mistake 2: Medication overuse

```
Problem: Using acute meds >2-3 days/week
Result: Rebound headaches, chronic pattern

Fix:
- Track medication use
- If hitting threshold, see doctor
- Focus on prevention
- Break rebound cycle

Prevention > acute treatment when frequent
```

### Mistake 3: Inconsistent lifestyle

```
Problem: Good during week, off on weekends
Result: Weekend migraines

Fix:
- Same schedule every day (yes, weekends too)
- Regular sleep, meals, exercise
- Boring but effective

Consistency is key
Exceptions are triggers
```

### Mistake 4: Not tracking triggers

```
Problem: "I get migraines sometimes, don't know why"
Result: Can't identify or avoid triggers

Fix:
- Systematic tracking (2-3 months)
- Look for patterns
- Test hypotheses
- Make targeted changes

Data beats guessing
Patterns emerge with time
```

### Mistake 5: Giving up too quickly

```
Problem: Try one preventive for 2 weeks, give up
Result: Never find effective prevention

Fix:
- Give preventives 2-3 months
- Work through side effects if tolerable
- Try multiple options if needed
- Work with specialist

Finding right treatment takes time
Persistence pays off
```

## Integration with Other Health Areas

### With Sleep Optimization:
**Sleep irregularity is major trigger:**
- Consistent schedule prevents migraines
- Good sleep = fewer attacks
- Poor sleep = more frequent, severe migraines
- Sleep disorders (apnea) worsen migraines

### With Nutrition System:
**Food triggers and timing:**
- Regular meals prevent migraines
- Specific foods can trigger
- Hydration critical
- Blood sugar stability matters

### With Fitness Protocol:
**Exercise as prevention:**
- Regular moderate exercise reduces frequency
- Overexertion can trigger
- Dehydration during exercise = risk
- Consistency matters
