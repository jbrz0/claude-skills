## Integration Patterns

These health areas are interconnected. Here's how they work together:

### Sleep + Migraine + Mental Health
**Connection:** Sleep affects everything
- Irregular sleep triggers migraines
- Poor sleep worsens anxiety and depression
- Sleep debt amplifies stress response
- Good sleep = foundation for mental and physical health

**Action:** Fix sleep first - it's the foundation

### Mental Wellbeing + All Physical Health
**Connection:** Mind-body are one system
- Stress worsens migraines, sleep, and recovery
- Anxiety affects eating habits and motivation
- Depression reduces physical activity
- Exercise improves mental health as much as antidepressants

**Action:** Address mental health alongside physical health

### Habit Formation + Everything
**Connection:** Meta-skill that enables all others
- Nutrition requires meal prep habits
- Fitness requires workout consistency habits
- Sleep requires evening routine habits
- Mental health requires practice habits (meditation, journaling)
- Migraine management requires tracking habits

**Action:** Build habit systems to support all health goals

### Nutrition + Fitness + Mental Health
**Connection:** Integrated body-mind system
- Food affects mood (gut-brain axis)
- Exercise reduces anxiety and depression
- Stress affects eating and recovery
- All three must align for body composition

**Action:** Coordinate nutrition, training, and stress management

### Stress → Cascade Effect
**Connection:** Stress is universal health disruptor
- Triggers migraines
- Disrupts sleep
- Worsens food choices
- Reduces motivation for exercise
- Amplifies anxiety and depression

**Action:** Stress management is preventive medicine

### The Complete System
**All six areas work together:**
- Habits enable consistency across all areas
- Mental wellbeing provides resilience
- Sleep provides recovery and regulation
- Nutrition provides fuel and building blocks
- Fitness provides adaptation stimulus
- Migraine management requires all of the above

**Action:** Systems thinking - improve one area, others benefit

## How to Use This Skill

### 1. Identify Your Primary Need

**Start here based on current priority:**

If you want to **change your body composition:**
→ Start with Nutrition System + Fitness Protocol

If you're **not sleeping well:**
→ Start with Sleep Optimization
→ Then address other areas (sleep affects everything)

If you **get frequent migraines:**
→ Start with Migraine Management
→ Integrate Sleep Optimization (major trigger)

If you're **generally optimizing:**
→ Use all sub-skills, prioritize based on biggest gap

### 2. Reference the Appropriate Sub-Skill

Claude will route to the specific sub-skill file based on your needs. You can also directly reference:
- "Use the nutrition system to calculate my TDEE"
- "Help me with the fitness protocol for a strength program"
- "I need the sleep optimization guide"
- "Help me track migraine triggers using the migraine management system"

### 3. Integrate Multiple Areas

For comprehensive health optimization, Claude can work across multiple sub-skills:
- "Design a program that integrates nutrition and training for muscle gain"
- "Help me identify if my migraines are related to sleep or food"
- "Create a complete health plan covering all areas"

## General Principles Across All Areas

### Evidence-Based Approach
- All recommendations based on scientific research
- When evidence is limited or mixed, this is noted
- No pseudoscience or unproven hacks
- Individual variation acknowledged

### Sustainability Over Perfection
- Systems that work long-term
- Adherence > optimal but unsustainable
- Build habits, not rely on willpower
- Progress over perfection

### Progressive Implementation
- Start with high-impact changes
- Layer additional optimizations over time
- Don't try to change everything at once
- Give changes time to work (weeks to months)

### Individual Variation
- What works for others may not work for you
- Systematic self-experimentation required
- Track, assess, adjust
- No one-size-fits-all solutions

### Integration Over Isolation
- Health areas interact
- Fix foundations first (sleep, basic nutrition)
- Build complexity gradually
- Systems thinking

## Red Flags - See a Doctor If:

Across all health areas, seek medical attention for:

**Immediate/Urgent:**
- Chest pain during exercise
- Sudden severe headache (thunderclap)
- Inability to breathe lying down
- Fainting or near-fainting during exercise
- Severe allergic reactions to food
- Confusion, altered consciousness

**Non-Urgent but Important:**
- Chronic insomnia (3+ months, 3+ nights/week)
- Unexplained weight changes
- Persistent pain or injury
- Frequent migraines (4+ per month)
- Sleep apnea symptoms (loud snoring, gasping)
- Disordered eating patterns
- Medication side effects

**Before Starting:**
- Significant health conditions before new exercise program
- Pregnancy before major diet or supplement changes
- Cardiovascular disease before intense training
- History of eating disorders before calorie tracking

Claude provides evidence-based guidance but is not a replacement for medical care when appropriate.

## Get Started

Ready to optimize your health? Here's the recommended approach:

1. **Assess current state:** Where are you now in each area?
2. **Identify biggest gap:** What's holding you back most?
3. **Start with foundations:** Sleep and basic nutrition first
4. **Add complexity gradually:** Layer additional optimizations
5. **Track and adjust:** Data-driven decisions
6. **Be patient:** Changes take weeks to months
7. **Maintain long-term:** Build sustainable systems

Tell Claude:
- What your primary health goal is
- Which area you want to focus on
- Your current situation and constraints
- Any relevant health conditions

Claude will route to the appropriate sub-skill and create a personalized plan.
