# Fitness Protocol

Expert in exercise programming, strength training, and physical performance optimization. Help design effective training programs, track progress, and achieve fitness goals through systematic, evidence-based approaches.

## Core Principles

**Progressive overload is non-negotiable**
- Muscles adapt to increasing demands
- Must progressively increase: weight, reps, volume, or intensity
- No overload = no progress

**Consistency beats intensity**
- 3-4 mediocre workouts per week > 1 perfect workout
- Showing up matters more than optimization
- Build the habit first, optimize second

**Recovery is when growth happens**
- Training is stimulus, not growth
- Sleep, nutrition, rest = actual adaptation
- More isn't always better

**Specificity matters**
- Train for your goals (strength ≠ hypertrophy ≠ endurance)
- Don't randomly mix everything
- Focus determines programming

**Goal:** Build a strong, functional, resilient body systematically

## Training Goals & Programming

### Strength Focus

**Goal: Lift maximum weight for low reps**

**Rep ranges:**
```
Primary: 1-5 reps
Secondary: 6-8 reps (accessory work)

Heavy enough that you couldn't do more reps
```

**Programming structure:**
```
Focus lifts: Squat, Deadlift, Bench Press, Overhead Press
Frequency: 3-4x per week
Volume: Lower (3-5 sets per exercise)
Rest: 3-5 minutes between heavy sets
Intensity: 80-95% of 1RM
```

**Sample week:**
```
Monday - Lower Power:
- Back Squat: 5x3 at 85%
- Romanian Deadlift: 4x6
- Leg Press: 3x8

Wednesday - Upper Power:
- Bench Press: 5x3 at 85%
- Barbell Row: 4x6
- Overhead Press: 3x8

Friday - Deadlift Focus:
- Deadlift: 5x3 at 85%
- Front Squat: 4x6
- Bulgarian Split Squat: 3x8 per leg

Saturday - Upper Volume:
- Bench Press: 4x8 at 70%
- Weighted Pull-ups: 4x6
- Dumbbell Press: 3x10
```

**Progression:**
```
Week 1: 5x3 at 80%
Week 2: 5x3 at 82.5%
Week 3: 5x3 at 85%
Week 4: 5x3 at 87.5%
Week 5: Deload (3x3 at 70%)
Week 6: Test new 1RM or restart at higher baseline
```

---

### Hypertrophy Focus

**Goal: Build muscle size**

**Rep ranges:**
```
Primary: 8-12 reps
Secondary: 6-15 reps (variety is good)

Failure at or near target reps
```

**Programming structure:**
```
Frequency: 4-6x per week
Volume: High (12-20 sets per muscle group per week)
Rest: 60-120 seconds
Intensity: 65-85% of 1RM
Time under tension: Emphasis on eccentric (lowering)
```

**Split options:**

**Push/Pull/Legs (PPL) - 6 days:**
```
Monday - Push:
- Bench Press: 4x8-10
- Incline Dumbbell Press: 4x10-12
- Overhead Press: 3x10-12
- Lateral Raises: 4x12-15
- Tricep Pushdowns: 3x12-15

Tuesday - Pull:
- Pull-ups: 4x8-10
- Barbell Rows: 4x8-10
- Lat Pulldowns: 3x10-12
- Face Pulls: 4x15-20
- Bicep Curls: 3x12-15

Wednesday - Legs:
- Squats: 4x8-10
- Romanian Deadlifts: 4x10-12
- Leg Press: 3x12-15
- Leg Curls: 3x12-15

Sunday - Rest
```

**Upper/Lower - 4 days:**
```
Monday - Upper:
- Bench Press: 4x8-10
- Barbell Row: 4x8-10
- Overhead Press: 3x10-12
- Pull-ups: 3x8-10
- Bicep/Tricep work: 3x12-15 each

Tuesday - Lower:
- Squats: 4x8-10
- Romanian Deadlift: 4x10-12
- Leg Press: 3x12-15
- Leg Curls: 3x12-15
- Abs: 3 sets

Thursday - Upper (different exercises)
Friday - Lower (different exercises)
```

**Progression:**
```
Double progression:
- Hit top of rep range on all sets → increase weight
- Example: 4x12 at 100lbs → next session 4x8 at 105lbs
- Work back up to 4x12, repeat

Or linear:
- Add 5lbs per week if hitting target reps
```

```

---

## Exercise Selection

### The Big Compounds

**Squat variations:**
```
Back squat: King of lower body, most weight possible
Front squat: More quad emphasis, better for mobility
Goblet squat: Beginner-friendly, great pattern
Bulgarian split squat: Unilateral strength, balance

Pick 1-2 for your program
Master the pattern before loading heavy
```

**Deadlift variations:**
```
Conventional deadlift: Posterior chain, total body strength
Sumo deadlift: More quad/adductor, less back
Romanian deadlift (RDL): Hamstring focus, less CNS fatigue
Trap bar deadlift: Hybrid squat/deadlift, beginner-friendly

Pick 1-2 for your program
Don't do heavy conventional + sumo same week (pick one)
```

**Pressing movements:**
```
Horizontal:
- Barbell bench press: Most weight, strength standard
- Dumbbell press: Better ROM, unilateral
- Push-ups: Bodyweight, anywhere

Vertical:
- Overhead press: Standing, full body tension
- Seated dumbbell press: More isolation
- Handstand push-ups: Advanced bodyweight

Incline:
- Incline bench: Upper chest emphasis
- Incline dumbbell: Better stretch

Pick 2-3 across categories
```

**Pulling movements:**
```
Vertical:
- Pull-ups/Chin-ups: King of back
- Lat pulldowns: If can't do pull-ups yet

Horizontal:
- Barbell row: Heavy, compound
- Dumbbell row: Unilateral, better ROM
- Seated cable row: Constant tension

Pick 2-3 across categories
Balance pushing volume with pulling (1:1 or 1:1.5 ratio)
```

---

### Accessory Work

**Shoulders:**
```
Lateral raises: Side delt (3D shoulders)
Face pulls: Rear delt + upper back health
Front raises: Front delt (often get enough from pressing)

Volume: 12-20 sets per week total
```

**Arms:**
```
Biceps:
- Barbell curls: Heavy
- Hammer curls: Brachialis
- Incline curls: Stretch position

Triceps:
- Close-grip bench: Compound
- Overhead extensions: Long head
- Pushdowns: Lateral head

Volume: 8-15 sets per week per muscle
```

**Legs:**
```
Quads:
- Leg extensions: Isolation
- Leg press: After squats
- Lunges: Unilateral

Hamstrings:
- Leg curls: Isolation
- RDLs: Compound
- Nordic curls: Eccentric emphasis

Calves:
- Standing calf raises: Gastrocnemius
- Seated calf raises: Soleus

Volume: Compounds usually sufficient, add isolation if lagging
```

**Core:**
```
Anti-extension: Planks, ab wheel
Anti-rotation: Pallof press, suitcase carries
Flexion: Cable crunches, hanging leg raises

Volume: 3-4 sessions per week, 3-5 sets
Don't neglect this (injury prevention + performance)
```

---

## Progression Schemes

### Linear Progression (Beginners)

**Add weight every session or week**

```
Starting point: Weight you can do 3x5 or 5x5 with good form

Session progression:
Week 1: Squat 135lbs 5x5
Week 2: Squat 140lbs 5x5
Week 3: Squat 145lbs 5x5
Week 4: Squat 150lbs 5x5

Continue until you fail
When you fail: Deload 10%, rebuild

Works for: First 6-12 months of training
Eventually: Need more sophisticated approach
```

### Double Progression (Intermediate)

**Add reps, then weight**

```
Target: 4 sets x 8-12 reps

Session 1: 4x8 at 100lbs (32 total reps)
Session 2: 4x9 at 100lbs (36 total reps)
Session 3: 4x10 at 100lbs (40 total reps)
Session 4: 4x11 at 100lbs (44 total reps)
Session 5: 4x12 at 100lbs (48 total reps)

Next session: Increase weight, drop back to 4x8
Session 6: 4x8 at 105lbs
Repeat process

Works for: Hypertrophy, steady progress
```

### Periodization (Advanced)

**Planned variation in volume and intensity**

**Block periodization:**
```
Block 1 (4 weeks): Hypertrophy
- High volume, moderate intensity
- 4x10-12 at 70-75%
- Build work capacity

Block 2 (4 weeks): Strength
- Moderate volume, high intensity
- 5x5 at 80-85%
- Build max strength

Block 3 (4 weeks): Power/Peak
- Low volume, very high intensity
- 5x3 at 85-90%
- Test maxes

Deload week
Repeat with higher baseline
```

**Daily undulating periodization (DUP):**
```
Monday: Hypertrophy day (4x10 at 70%)
Wednesday: Strength day (5x5 at 85%)
Friday: Power day (8x3 at 80%)

Vary stimulus within same week
Good for intermediate/advanced
```

---

## Training Frequency

### How often to train each muscle:

**Once per week:**
```
Pros: Full recovery, can go very hard
Cons: Suboptimal for most goals (not enough frequency)
Works for: Advanced bodybuilders with crazy volume per session

Generally: Not recommended unless specific reason
```

**Twice per week:**
```
Pros: Good balance of stimulus and recovery
Cons: None really (solid frequency)
Works for: Most people, most goals

Example: Upper/Lower split 4x per week
- Each muscle group hit 2x
- Adequate recovery between sessions
```

**Three times per week:**
```
Pros: Frequent stimulus, practice technique more
Cons: Need to manage fatigue carefully
Works for: Strength focus, full body programs

Example: Monday/Wednesday/Friday full body
- Squat, Press, Pull each session
- Vary intensity and exercise selection
```

---

## Volume Landmarks

### How much volume per muscle group:

**General guidelines (sets per week):**
```
Minimum Effective Volume (MEV): 8-10 sets
- Absolute minimum to see progress
- Better than nothing

Optimal Volume: 12-18 sets
- Sweet spot for most people
- Maximum growth without overdoing

Maximum Recoverable Volume (MRV): 20-25 sets
- Max you can handle and still recover
- More is not better beyond this

Individual variation: Some need more, some less
Start middle, adjust based on recovery
```

**Examples:**
```
Chest (12-18 sets/week):
- Bench press: 4x8 = 4 sets
- Incline dumbbell: 4x10 = 4 sets
- Cable fly: 3x12 = 3 sets
- Push-ups: 3x15 = 3 sets
Total: 14 sets

Back (15-20 sets/week):
- Pull-ups: 4x8 = 4 sets
- Barbell row: 4x8 = 4 sets
- Lat pulldown: 3x12 = 3 sets
- Face pulls: 4x15 = 4 sets
- Cable row: 3x12 = 3 sets
Total: 18 sets
```

**Hard sets vs junk volume:**
```
Hard set: Within 0-3 reps of failure
Junk volume: Easy sets that don't stimulate adaptation

Count only hard sets toward weekly volume
Going through the motions doesn't count
```

---

## Form & Technique

### Squat:

**Setup:**
```
- Bar on traps (high bar) or rear delts (low bar)
- Feet shoulder-width, toes slightly out
- Grip narrow, elbows down
- Big breath, brace core

Descent:
- Break at knees and hips simultaneously
- Keep chest up, weight mid-foot
- Depth: Hip crease below knee (parallel or deeper)
- Knees track over toes

Ascent:
- Drive through mid-foot
- Keep chest up
- Squeeze glutes at top
- Exhale
```

**Common errors:**
```
✗ Knees caving in (valgus)
✗ Weight on toes (heels come up)
✗ Chest collapsing forward (good morning squat)
✗ Not hitting depth
✗ Losing tightness in the hole
```

### Deadlift:

**Setup:**
```
- Feet hip-width, under bar
- Bar over mid-foot
- Grip outside legs
- Shoulders slightly in front of bar
- Neutral spine, big breath

Pull:
- Brace core hard
- Push floor away with legs
- Hips and shoulders rise together
- Bar stays close to body
- Lock out standing tall

Descent:
- Control back down
- Hip hinge, then bend knees
- Don't drop the bar (unless bumper plates)
```

**Common errors:**
```
✗ Rounded back (injury risk)
✗ Bar drifts away from body
✗ Hips shoot up first (turns into stiff-leg)
✗ Hyperextending at top
✗ Not bracing properly
```

### Bench Press:

**Setup:**
```
- Eyes under bar
- Feet flat on floor
- Arch upper back, squeeze shoulder blades
- Unrack with straight arms

Press:
- Lower to chest (nipple line)
- Elbows at ~45 degrees (not flared)
- Touch chest, then press
- Bar path slightly diagonal (toward face)
- Lock out at top
```

**Common errors:**
```
✗ Elbows flared 90 degrees (shoulder stress)
✗ Bouncing off chest
✗ Butt coming off bench
✗ Not touching chest
✗ Inconsistent bar path
```

---

## Recovery & Deloads

### Recovery needs:

**Between sessions:**
```
Muscle group: 48-72 hours
CNS (heavy compounds): 48-96 hours

Can train same muscle 2x/week if:
- Vary intensity
- Manage total volume
- Sleep and nutrition dialed in
```

**Overtraining signs:**
```
- Performance declining despite effort
- Chronic fatigue
- Sleep issues
- Irritability
- Elevated resting heart rate
- Nagging injuries not healing
- Loss of motivation

If experiencing multiple: Deload or rest week needed
```

### Deload protocols:

**When to deload:**
```
Every 4-6 weeks of hard training
Or when showing overtraining signs

Don't skip deloads (ego trap)
They're part of progression, not weakness
```

**How to deload:**

**Option 1: Reduce volume (best):**
```
Keep intensity same, cut volume by 50%

Normal week: 4x8 at 100lbs
Deload week: 2x8 at 100lbs

Maintains strength, reduces fatigue
```

**Option 2: Reduce intensity:**
```
Keep volume same, cut weight by 30%

Normal week: 4x8 at 100lbs
Deload week: 4x8 at 70lbs

Maintains movement patterns, reduces CNS stress
```

**Option 3: Full rest week:**
```
Take entire week off

Use for: Accumulated fatigue, life stress, minor injury
Don't worry about losing gains (won't happen in 1 week)
Come back refreshed
```

---

## Warm-up Structure

**General warm-up (5-10 min):**
```
Goal: Increase heart rate, blood flow
Methods:
- Light cardio (bike, row, jog)
- Jump rope
- Dynamic stretching

Not static stretching (reduces force production)
```

**Specific warm-up:**
```
Ramp up to working weight

Working set: Bench press 4x8 at 200lbs

Warm-up:
- Bar x 10 (45lbs)
- 95lbs x 8
- 135lbs x 5
- 165lbs x 3
- 185lbs x 1
- 200lbs x 8 (first working set)

Gradually increase weight, decrease reps
Practice movement pattern
Prepare nervous system
```

**Activation work (optional):**
```
Before squats: Glute bridges, band walks
Before bench: Band pull-aparts, face pulls
Before deadlifts: Hip hinges, RDLs with light weight

3-5 minutes max
Prime the muscles you're about to use
```

---

## Tracking Progress

### What to track:

**Minimum:**
```
- Exercises
- Weight
- Reps
- Sets

Every single workout
Use app (Strong, Hevy) or notebook
```

**Better:**
```
Add:
- RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion, 1-10 scale)
- Rest times
- Notes (felt strong/weak, tweaked something, etc.)

Helps identify patterns
```

**Optional:**
```
- Body weight (weekly)
- Body measurements (monthly)
- Progress photos (monthly)
- 1RM estimates or tests (every 8-12 weeks)

Good for motivation and tracking trends
```

### Progress indicators:

**Strength goals:**
```
Increasing weight on the bar
More reps at same weight
Same weight but easier (lower RPE)
Hitting PR lifts

Clear, objective measures
```

**Hypertrophy goals:**
```
Volume increasing over time
Body measurements increasing
Visual changes (photos)
Weight gain (if bulking)

Takes longer to see than strength gains
```

---

## Program Examples

Squat: 3x5
Bench Press: 3x5
Barbell Row: 3x5
Overhead Press: 3x8
Romanian Deadlift: 3x8
Face Pulls: 3x15
Plank: 3x30-60 seconds

Linear progression: Add 5lbs per session
Duration: 3-6 months until stalls
```

### Intermediate Upper/Lower (4 days):

```
Monday - Upper:
Bench Press: 4x6-8
Barbell Row: 4x6-8
Overhead Press: 3x8-10
Pull-ups: 3x8-10
Lateral Raises: 3x12-15

```

---

## Cardio Integration

### Cardio for strength/hypertrophy athletes:

**Minimum for health:**
```
150 minutes moderate intensity per week
OR 75 minutes vigorous per week

Spread across week
Can be: Walking, cycling, swimming, sports
```

**How to add without interfering:**
```
Option 1: Low intensity steady state (LISS)
- Walking, easy cycling
- 30-60 minutes
- After lifting or off days
- Minimal interference with strength

Option 2: High intensity interval training (HIIT)
- 10-20 minutes
- After lifting
- More efficient but more fatiguing
- 2-3x per week max

Option 3: Active recovery days
- Light cardio on rest days
- Aids recovery
- 20-30 minutes easy pace
```

**Don't:**
```
✗ Run long distance before leg day (fatigued for squats)
✗ Do intense cardio every day (can't recover)
✗ Prioritize cardio over lifting (if strength/muscle is goal)
```

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Program hopping

```
Problem: New program every 2 weeks
Results: No progress (didn't give it time)

Fix:
- Commit to program for 8-12 weeks minimum
- Track progress objectively
- Only switch if truly stalling or goal changes
```

### Mistake 2: Not progressively overloading

```
Problem: Same weights for months
Results: No adaptation, no growth

Fix:
- Track every workout
- Aim to add weight or reps each session
- If can't progress, reassess (volume? recovery? nutrition?)
```

### Mistake 3: Ego lifting

```
Problem: Loading too heavy, form breaks down
Results: Injury, poor stimulus, no progress

Fix:
- Check ego at door
- Film yourself
- If form breaks down, weight is too heavy
- Perfect reps > heavier weight
```

### Mistake 4: Not eating enough

```
Problem: Trying to build muscle in calorie deficit
Results: Minimal gains, frustration

Fix:
- Slight surplus (200-300 calories) for muscle gain
- 0.8-1g protein per lb bodyweight
- Can't out-train a bad diet
```

### Mistake 5: Not resting enough

```
Problem: Training 7 days/week, no deloads
Results: Overtraining, injuries, burnout

Fix:
- Rest days are growth days
- Deload every 4-6 weeks
- Sleep 7-9 hours
- Recovery is when adaptation happens
```

---

## Integration with Other Health Areas

### With Nutrition System
**Training stimulus requires fuel:**
- Protein: 0.8-1g per lb for muscle growth
- Calories: Surplus for gaining, maintenance for recomp
- Timing: Pre/post workout nutrition for performance
- Supplements: Creatine, protein powder support goals

### With Sleep Optimization
**Recovery happens during sleep:**
- Growth hormone release during deep sleep
- Muscle repair overnight
- CNS recovery for next session
- Poor sleep = poor gains

### With Migraine Management
**Exercise can trigger or prevent:**
- Intense training: Potential trigger
- Regular moderate exercise: Can reduce frequency
- Monitor patterns, adjust intensity if needed

---

## Red Flags

**Your program needs adjustment if:**
```
☐ Not progressively overloading for 4+ weeks
☐ Constant injuries or pain
☐ Dreading every workout (burnout)
☐ Performance declining despite effort
☐ Not tracking workouts
☐ Switching programs constantly
☐ All high intensity, no recovery
☐ Form degrading to lift more weight
☐ Not seeing any visual or strength changes in 3+ months
```
