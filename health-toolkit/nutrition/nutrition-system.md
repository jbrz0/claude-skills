# Nutrition System

Expert in evidence-based nutrition, macro tracking, and sustainable dietary habits. Help optimize nutrition for performance, body composition, and health through systematic, flexible approaches.

## Core Principles

**Calories determine weight change**
- Eat more than you burn = gain weight
- Eat less than you burn = lose weight
- Eat at maintenance = stay same
- This is physics, not negotiable

**Macros matter for body composition**
- Protein: Muscle building/retention
- Carbs: Performance fuel
- Fats: Hormones, satiety
- Getting these right = better results

**Sustainability beats perfection**
- Perfect diet you can't stick to = useless
- Good diet you follow 80% = results
- Consistency over months/years wins

**Whole foods are the foundation**
- Processed foods aren't evil, but...
- Whole foods: More filling, more nutrients
- 80-90% whole foods, 10-20% flexible

**Goal:** Build sustainable eating habits that support your goals

## Calorie Targets

### Calculate your needs:

**Step 1: Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)**
```
Mifflin-St Jeor equation (most accurate):

Men: (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age) + 5
Women: (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age) - 161

Example (30-year-old male, 180lbs/82kg, 6'0"/183cm):
BMR = (10 × 82) + (6.25 × 183) - (5 × 30) + 5
BMR = 820 + 1,144 - 150 + 5
BMR = 1,819 calories

This is what you burn doing nothing (coma calories)
```

**Step 2: Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)**
```
Multiply BMR by activity factor:

Sedentary (little/no exercise): BMR × 1.2
Lightly active (1-3 days/week): BMR × 1.375
Moderately active (3-5 days/week): BMR × 1.55
Very active (6-7 days/week): BMR × 1.725
Extremely active (athlete, physical job): BMR × 1.9

Example (moderate activity):
TDEE = 1,819 × 1.55 = 2,820 calories

This is maintenance calories
```

**Step 3: Adjust for goals**
```
Fat loss: TDEE - 500 calories (1lb/week loss)
Aggressive cut: TDEE - 750 calories (1.5lb/week loss)
Maintenance: TDEE
Lean bulk: TDEE + 300 calories (gain ~2lbs/month)
Aggressive bulk: TDEE + 500 calories (gain ~4lbs/month)

Example fat loss goal:
2,820 - 500 = 2,320 calories per day
```

**Reality check:**
```
These are estimates, not gospel
Start with calculation, then adjust based on:
- Actual weight change over 2 weeks
- Losing too fast? Add 100-200 calories
- Not losing? Subtract 100-200 calories
- Gaining too fast? Reduce calories
- Not gaining? Add calories

Your real TDEE = what the scale tells you
```

## Macronutrients

### Protein:

**How much:**
```
General health: 0.6-0.8g per lb bodyweight
Building muscle: 0.8-1g per lb bodyweight
Cutting (preserve muscle): 1-1.2g per lb bodyweight

Example (180lb person building muscle):
180 × 0.9 = 162g protein per day

More than 1.2g/lb: No added benefit (just expensive)
```

**Why it matters:**
```
Muscle building: Provides amino acids
Satiety: Most filling macro (helps with adherence)
Thermic effect: Burns 20-30% of calories digesting
Muscle preservation: Critical in calorie deficit
```

**Best sources:**
```
Lean meats: Chicken breast, turkey, lean beef (25-30g per 4oz)
Fish: Salmon, tuna, cod (20-25g per 4oz)
Eggs: Whole eggs (6g per egg)
Dairy: Greek yogurt (20g per cup), cottage cheese (25g per cup)
Protein powder: Whey, casein (20-30g per scoop)
Plant: Tofu, tempeh, seitan, lentils (varies widely)

Prioritize lean sources when cutting
Can use fattier sources when bulking
```

### Carbohydrates:

**How much:**
```
Depends on activity level and preference

Low carb: 50-100g (20% of 2000 cal diet)
Moderate: 150-250g (30-50% of diet)
High carb: 300+ (50-60% of diet)

Active people: Need more carbs for performance
Sedentary: Can do fine with less
Personal preference: Big factor

Example (active person, 2,320 cal diet, 40% carbs):
2,320 × 0.40 = 928 calories from carbs
928 ÷ 4 cal/g = 232g carbs
```

**Why it matters:**
```
Energy: Primary fuel for high intensity exercise
Performance: More carbs = better workouts generally
Muscle glycogen: Needed for muscle fullness
Recovery: Replenishes glycogen post-workout
```

**Best sources:**
```
Complex carbs:
- Rice (white or brown): 45g per cup
- Oats: 27g per 1/2 cup dry
- Potatoes: 35g per medium potato
- Quinoa: 40g per cup
- Whole grain bread: 15-20g per slice

Simple carbs:
- Fruit: 15-30g per piece
- Honey: 17g per tablespoon

Around workouts: Fast-digesting (white rice, fruit)
Rest of day: Slower-digesting (oats, sweet potato)
```

### Fats:

**How much:**
```
Minimum for health: 0.3g per lb bodyweight
Optimal range: 0.3-0.5g per lb bodyweight

Example (180lb person):
180 × 0.4 = 72g fat per day

Don't go below 0.3 (hormone issues)
No need to go crazy high unless keto
```

**Why it matters:**
```
Hormones: Testosterone, estrogen production
Satiety: Keeps you full
Absorption: Vitamins A, D, E, K need fat
Brain function: Essential fatty acids
```

**Best sources:**
```
Healthy fats:
- Olive oil: 14g per tablespoon
- Nuts/seeds: 15-20g per ounce
- Avocado: 15g per half
- Fatty fish: 10-15g per 4oz
- Whole eggs: 5g per egg
- Nut butters: 8g per tablespoon

Limit saturated fats: <10% of total calories
Avoid trans fats: Completely
```

## Meal Timing

### Does it matter?

**What doesn't matter much:**
```
✗ Eating breakfast vs skipping
✗ 6 small meals vs 3 big meals
✗ Eating late at night
✗ Specific meal timing windows (outside training)

Total daily intake > timing
Do what fits your lifestyle
```

**What does matter:**

**Pre-workout nutrition:**
```
Goal: Fuel performance, prevent bonking

Timing: 1-3 hours before
Content: 
- Carbs: 30-60g (fuel)
- Protein: 20-30g (prevent breakdown)
- Low fat (digests slowly)

Examples:
- Rice, chicken (2-3 hours before)
- Banana, protein shake (1 hour before)
- Oats, whey protein (2 hours before)

Experiment with timing that feels good
```

**Post-workout nutrition:**
```
Goal: Recovery, replenish glycogen

Timing: Within 2-3 hours (anabolic window is longer than you think)
Content:
- Protein: 30-40g (muscle repair)
- Carbs: 40-80g (glycogen replenishment)

Examples:
- Chicken, rice
- Protein shake, banana
- Salmon, potato

Not magical, but good practice
Total daily > post-workout specifically
```

**Protein distribution:**
```
Goal: Maximize muscle protein synthesis (MPS)

Optimal: 4-5 meals with 30-40g protein each
Minimum: 3 meals with 40-50g protein each

MPS triggered every 3-5 hours
Spreading protein > one huge meal

Example (180g protein target):
- Meal 1: 40g
- Meal 2: 40g
- Meal 3: 40g
- Meal 4: 40g
- Snacks: 20g
Total: 180g across day
```

---

## Nutrient Timing for Performance

### Training days vs rest days:

**Training days (higher carbs):**
```
Need fuel for workout
Prioritize carbs around training
Example (2,500 cal):
- Protein: 180g
- Carbs: 300g (higher)
- Fat: 65g (lower)

Carb placement:
- Pre-workout: 40-60g
- Post-workout: 50-80g
- Rest throughout day
```

**Rest days (optional: lower carbs, higher fat):**
```
Less need for glycogen
Can reduce carbs if desired
Example (2,500 cal):
- Protein: 180g
- Carbs: 200g (lower)
- Fat: 89g (higher)

More flexible
Focus on protein target
```

**Note:** Cycling is optional, not required
```
Some prefer:
- Same macros every day (simpler)
- Adjust by hunger (intuitive)

Both work fine
Do what you'll stick to
```

---

## Supplements

### Evidence-based essentials:

**Creatine:**
```
What: Increases ATP production
Dose: 5g per day, every day
Benefits: 
- Strength gains (5-15%)
- Muscle gain (via training harder)
- Cognitive benefits
- Safe, cheap, effective

Type: Creatine monohydrate (don't overpay for fancy versions)
Timing: Doesn't matter (daily total matters)
Loading: Optional (20g/day for 5 days, then 5g/day)
```

**Protein powder:**
```
What: Convenient protein source
Dose: As needed to hit protein target
Benefits:
- Easy to get protein in
- Cost-effective per gram
- Versatile (shakes, oats, etc.)

Types:
- Whey: Fast-digesting, post-workout
- Casein: Slow-digesting, before bed
- Plant: Vegan option (pea, rice blend)

Not necessary if hitting protein from whole foods
But very convenient
```

**Vitamin D:**
```
What: Fat-soluble vitamin (acts like hormone)
Dose: 2,000-4,000 IU per day
Benefits:
- Immune function
- Bone health  
- Mood regulation
- Testosterone support

Why supplement:
- Hard to get from food
- Sun exposure often insufficient
- Most people deficient

Get blood test to confirm deficiency
```

**Fish oil (Omega-3):**
```
What: EPA and DHA fatty acids
Dose: 1-2g combined EPA+DHA per day
Benefits:
- Heart health
- Inflammation reduction
- Joint health
- Brain function

If eating fatty fish 2-3x/week: May not need
Otherwise: Good insurance policy
```

### Optional (may help):

**Caffeine:**
```
Performance enhancer
Dose: 3-6mg per kg bodyweight pre-workout
Benefits: Energy, focus, power output
Caution: Tolerance builds, can affect sleep
```

**Beta-alanine:**
```
Buffers lactic acid
Dose: 3-5g per day
Benefits: Endurance in 60-240 second efforts
Side effect: Tingling sensation (harmless)
```

### Skip these (waste of money):

```
✗ BCAAs (if eating enough protein)
✗ Testosterone boosters (unless prescribed)
✗ Fat burners (just caffeine at 10x price)
✗ Detoxes/cleanses (liver and kidneys do this)
✗ Most pre-workouts (caffeine + marketing)

Save your money
Focus on basics: food, sleep, training
```

## Fat Loss Strategies

### The fundamentals:

**Calorie deficit is required**
```
No deficit = no fat loss
All diets work via this mechanism
Low carb, keto, intermittent fasting, etc. = ways to create deficit

Don't fall for gimmicks
Deficit is what matters
```

**Rate of loss:**
```
Healthy rate: 0.5-1% bodyweight per week

180lb person:
- 0.9-1.8lbs per week
- Too fast: Muscle loss, metabolic adaptation
- Too slow: Takes forever, adherence issues

Sweet spot: 1% per week generally
```

**Hunger management:**

**Protein is king:**
```
Most satiating macro
Aim for higher end (1-1.2g/lb)
Keeps you full, preserves muscle
```

**Volume eating:**
```
Low-calorie dense foods = more food volume

Good: Vegetables (unlimited basically)
Good: Fruits (moderate calories, high fiber)
Good: Lean proteins (chicken, fish)
Good: Potatoes (very filling per calorie)

Avoid: Calorie-dense foods when hungry
- Nuts (200 cal in handful)
- Oils (120 cal per tablespoon)
- Nut butters (easy to overeat)
```

**Fiber:**
```
Target: 25-35g per day

Slows digestion
Increases satiety
Regulates blood sugar

Sources: Vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans
```

**Meal frequency:**
```
Whatever keeps you satisfied

Options:
- 3 bigger meals (if you like being full)
- 5-6 smaller meals (if you like eating often)
- Intermittent fasting (if you don't like breakfast)

Total daily calories > distribution
```

### Diet breaks:

**Why take them:**
```
Long cuts (12+ weeks): Metabolic adaptation happens
Leptin decreases, hunger increases
Diet break: 2 weeks at maintenance

Benefits:
- Restore leptin
- Psychological break
- Resets hunger signals
- Prepare for next cut phase

Every 8-12 weeks of cutting
Doesn't undo progress
Actually helps long-term
```

### Refeeds:

**Strategic high-carb days:**
```
During cut: 1 day per week at maintenance or higher

Example:
6 days: 2,000 calories (deficit)
1 day: 2,500 calories (maintenance or slight surplus)

Benefits:
- Replenish glycogen
- Psychological break
- Training performance boost

Mostly carbs, keep protein/fat constant
```

---

## Muscle Gain Strategies

### The fundamentals:

**Calorie surplus is required**
```
No surplus = minimal muscle gain
Can recomp (lose fat, gain muscle) as beginner or returning
But best results: Slight surplus

200-300 calories above maintenance
Enough to build, not enough to get fat
```

**Rate of gain:**
```
Realistic muscle gain:

Beginner (Year 1): 1-2lbs muscle per month
Intermediate (Year 2-3): 0.5-1lb per month
Advanced (Year 4+): 0.25-0.5lb per month

Gaining faster? Likely fat too
Aim for 2-4lbs total gain per month when bulking
Half will be muscle (good outcome)
```

**Clean bulk vs dirty bulk:**

**Clean bulk (recommended):**
```
Surplus: 200-300 calories
Whole foods: 80-90%
Rate: 2-3lbs per month
Result: Muscle with minimal fat gain

Takes discipline
More time in bulk phase
Less time cutting later
```

**Dirty bulk (not recommended):**
```
Surplus: 500+ calories
Food quality: Whatever
Rate: 4-6lbs per month
Result: Muscle + significant fat gain

Fun in short term
Get fat fast
Have to cut for months later
Not efficient
```

### Nutrient timing for muscle gain:

**Protein:**
```
Spread throughout day
30-40g per meal (4-5 meals)
Before bed: Casein or slow protein (muscle repair overnight)
```

**Carbs:**
```
Prioritize around training
Pre-workout: Energy
Post-workout: Recovery
Rest of day: Flexibility
```

**Anabolic window:**
```
Real, but not as tight as thought
Get protein + carbs within 3-4 hours of training
Doesn't need to be immediate shake in locker room
Total daily intake > precise timing
```

---

## Tracking & Adherence

### How to track:

**App-based (recommended):**
```
MyFitnessPal: Most foods in database
MacroFactor: Auto-adjusts based on progress
Cronometer: Best for micronutrients

Process:
1. Set calorie and macro targets
2. Log everything you eat
3. Weigh food for accuracy (at least initially)
4. Adjust based on results
```

**Weighing food:**
```
Kitchen scale: $15-20 investment

Critical for:
- High-calorie foods (nuts, oils, PB)
- Protein sources (chicken, fish)
- Carbs (rice, pasta, oats)

Estimate okay for:
- Vegetables (low calorie, doesn't matter much)
- Condiments (track, but don't need precision)

First 2-4 weeks: Weigh everything (learn portions)
After: Can eyeball most things
```

### 80/20 rule:

**Flexible dieting:**
```
80% whole, nutrient-dense foods
20% whatever you want

Example (2,500 calories):
- 2,000 from whole foods (protein, complex carbs, healthy fats)
- 500 flexible (ice cream, pizza, beer, etc.)

Sustainability: Can do this forever
Results: Still hit macro targets
Enjoyment: Don't feel deprived

Key: Fit treats into macros
Not: Go crazy on flexible 20%
```

### Adherence strategies:

**Plan ahead:**
```
Don't rely on willpower

Strategies:
- Meal prep Sunday for week
- Pre-log meals morning of
- Keep trigger foods out of house
- Have go-to restaurants with macro-friendly options
```

**Social situations:**
```
Don't be weird about it

Options:
- Eat lighter earlier in day (save calories)
- Make smart choices (protein + veggies)
- Estimate best you can (don't stress)
- Enjoy yourself, get back on track tomorrow

One meal doesn't ruin progress
One day doesn't matter
Consistency over weeks = results
```

**Hunger management:**
```
- Drink water first (often thirsty, not hungry)
- High-volume, low-cal foods (veggies, fruits)
- Protein at every meal
- Fiber-rich foods
- Black coffee or tea (appetite suppressant)
- Stay busy (boredom = eating)
```

---

## Special Considerations

### Vegetarian/Vegan:

**Protein sources:**
```
Complete proteins:
- Soy: Tofu, tempeh, edamame (15-20g per serving)
- Seitan: Wheat gluten (25g per serving)
- Quinoa: Grain (8g per cup)

Combine for complete profile:
- Beans + rice
- Peanut butter + bread
- Hummus + pita

Supplement:
- Pea protein powder
- Rice protein powder
- Hemp protein powder
```

**Nutrients to watch:**
```
Vitamin B12: Supplement (no plant sources)
Iron: Spinach, lentils, fortified foods + vitamin C
Omega-3: Algae oil (EPA/DHA)
Zinc: Beans, nuts, seeds, supplement if needed
Vitamin D: Supplement (most people need anyway)

Possible, but requires more planning
```

### Intermittent Fasting:

**What it is:**
```
Eating window restriction
Common: 16:8 (fast 16 hours, eat 8 hours)
Example: Eat 12pm-8pm, fast 8pm-12pm next day

Not magic, just calorie control method
Easier for some to stick to
```

**Benefits:**
```
✓ Simplifies eating (fewer meals to plan)
✓ Hunger blunts after adaptation (2 weeks)
✓ Can eat larger, more satisfying meals
✓ Improved insulin sensitivity (debated)

Works well for people who:
- Don't like breakfast
- Prefer larger meals
- Have busy mornings
```

**Drawbacks:**
```
✗ Harder to hit protein target (fewer meals)
✗ Can affect performance if training fasted
✗ Not better for fat loss than other methods
✗ Social complications (eating windows)

Not necessary
Just another tool
```

### Competition prep / Contest diet:

**Extreme fat loss:**
```
Not sustainable or healthy long-term
Only for bodybuilding/physique competitions

Requires:
- Very low calories (1,200-1,800)
- Very high protein (1.2-1.5g/lb)
- High cardio volume
- Perfect adherence
- Mental toughness

Don't do this unless competing
Not worth the suffering for "shredded abs"
Health impacts: Hormones, mood, energy, social life
```

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Not tracking properly

```
Problem: "I eat healthy but can't lose weight"
Reality: Underestimating calories by 30-50%

Fix:
- Weigh food for 2 weeks (learn portions)
- Log everything (cooking oils, bites, drinks)
- Be honest with yourself
- Numbers don't lie
```

### Mistake 2: Too aggressive deficit

```
Problem: 1,000-1,500 calorie deficit
Results: Muscle loss, metabolic damage, misery

Fix:
- 500 calorie deficit max (750 if very overweight)
- Lose 1% bodyweight per week
- Preserve muscle, stay sane
- Slower = sustainable
```

### Mistake 3: Neglecting protein

```
Problem: 50-80g protein per day
Results: Muscle loss, always hungry

Fix:
- 0.8-1g per lb bodyweight minimum
- Prioritize protein at every meal
- Use protein powder if needed
- Non-negotiable for body composition
```

### Mistake 4: Demonizing foods

```
Problem: "Carbs make you fat" / "Fat makes you fat"
Reality: Excess calories make you fat

Fix:
- No foods are off-limits
- Context and dose matter
- Fit treats into macros
- Enjoy food, track it
```

### Mistake 5: All-or-nothing mentality

```
Problem: Perfect all week, binge weekend
Reality: Net calories matter

Fix:
- 80/20 approach
- One bad meal = get back on track
- Progress > perfection
- Consistency beats intensity
```

## Integration with Other Health Areas

### With Fitness Protocol
**Nutrition fuels training:**
- Protein: 0.8-1g/lb for muscle growth
- Carbs: Around training for performance
- Calories: Surplus for gaining, deficit for cutting
- Timing: Pre/post workout optimization

### With Sleep Optimization
**Food affects sleep:**
- Large meals before bed: Can disrupt
- Protein before bed: May improve recovery
- Caffeine cut-off: 6-8 hours before sleep
- Carbs at night: May improve sleep quality

### With Migraine Management
**Diet triggers are individual:**
- Common triggers: Alcohol, caffeine withdrawal, aged cheese
- Hydration: Critical for prevention
- Regular meals: Blood sugar stability
- Track patterns: Food journal
