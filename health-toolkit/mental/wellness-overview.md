Prevention and early intervention key
```

---

## Stress Management

### Understanding stress:

**Stress response (fight/flight):**
```
Acute stress is adaptive:
- Increases alertness
- Mobilizes energy
- Sharpens focus
- Prepares for action

Designed for short-term threats
Problem: Modern stressors are chronic
Can't run from deadline or difficult boss
```

**Chronic stress effects:**
```
Physical:
- Elevated cortisol
- Inflammation
- Poor sleep
- Weakened immunity
- Weight gain (especially belly fat)
- Cardiovascular strain

Mental:
- Anxiety, irritability
- Depression risk
- Cognitive impairment
- Motivation loss

Behavioral:
- Poor food choices
- Substance use
- Social withdrawal
- Exercise avoidance
```

**Stress vs stressor:**
```
Stressor: External event (work deadline, traffic)
Stress: Your response to the event

Key insight: You can't always control stressor
But: You can change your response
This is where intervention happens
```

### Daily stress reduction:

**Box breathing (4-4-4-4):**
```
Technique:
1. Inhale for 4 seconds
2. Hold for 4 seconds
3. Exhale for 4 seconds
4. Hold for 4 seconds
5. Repeat 4-5 rounds

Why it works:
- Activates parasympathetic nervous system
- Slows heart rate
- Reduces cortisol
- Immediate calming effect

Use when: Feeling stressed, before difficult situations
Takes: 2-3 minutes
```

**4-7-8 breathing:**
```
Technique:
1. Inhale through nose for 4 seconds
2. Hold breath for 7 seconds
3. Exhale through mouth for 8 seconds
4. Repeat 4 times

Why it works:
- Longer exhale = relaxation response
- Reduces anxiety quickly
- Helps with sleep

Use when: High anxiety, trouble falling asleep
```

**Progressive muscle relaxation:**
```
Process:
1. Tense muscle group (fists, arms, shoulders, etc.)
2. Hold tension 5 seconds
3. Release and notice relaxation
4. Move through whole body

Why it works:
- Releases physical tension
- Increases body awareness
- Interrupts stress loop

Use when: Physical tension, evening wind-down
Takes: 10-15 minutes
```

**Meditation (mindfulness):**
```
Basic practice:
1. Sit comfortably, eyes closed
2. Focus on breath
3. Notice when mind wanders
4. Gently return focus to breath
5. Repeat for 10-20 minutes

Not about stopping thoughts
About noticing them without judgment
Building attention control

Benefits (with regular practice):
- Reduced stress and anxiety
- Better emotional regulation
- Improved focus
- Lower cortisol
- Brain structure changes (more gray matter)

Start: 5 minutes daily
Build: To 10-20 minutes
Consistency: Daily practice matters more than duration

Apps: Headspace, Calm, Waking Up, Insight Timer
```

**Physical exercise:**
```
Best stress reliever:
- Reduces cortisol
- Increases endorphins
- Improves mood
- Enhances sleep
- Builds confidence

Doesn't need to be intense:
- 30-minute walk is powerful
- Yoga combines movement + mindfulness
- Any activity you enjoy

Acute: Helps immediately after
Chronic: Builds resilience over time

Integration: See fitness-protocol.md
```

**Time in nature:**
```
"Green prescription"

Benefits:
- Reduced cortisol
- Lower blood pressure
- Improved mood
- Restored attention
- Perspective shift

Minimum: 20 minutes
Optimal: 2 hours/week in nature

Even urban green spaces help
Forest bathing (shinrin-yoku) powerful
```

**Social connection:**
```
Strong relationships = stress buffer

Quality over quantity:
- One deep conversation > many shallow
- Vulnerability builds connection
- Reciprocal support essential

For introverts:
- Small group or one-on-one
- Doesn't need to be frequent
- But needs to be meaningful

Isolation amplifies stress
Connection reduces it
```

**Hobbies and flow states:**
```
Flow: Absorbed in challenging but achievable activity

Characteristics:
- Lose track of time
- Fully engaged
- Skill matches challenge
- Intrinsically rewarding

Examples:
- Creative work (art, music, writing)
- Sports or physical skills
- Games or puzzles
- Crafts and making

Benefit: Complete break from rumination
Regular flow = resilience building
```

### Cognitive stress management:

**Thought reframing:**
```
Automatic thoughts often distorted

Common distortions:
- Catastrophizing ("This will be a disaster")
- All-or-nothing ("I'm a complete failure")
- Mind reading ("They think I'm stupid")
- Fortune telling ("This will go badly")

Reframing process:
1. Notice the thought
2. Is it helpful or accurate?
3. What's the evidence for/against?
4. What's a more balanced view?

Example:
Thought: "I'm going to fail this presentation"
Reframe: "I'm prepared, and even if it's not perfect, I'll learn from it"

Not toxic positivity
But realistic, balanced thinking
```

**Worry scheduling:**
```
Problem: Constant worrying throughout day

Solution: Designated worry time

Process:
1. When worry appears during day, note it
2. Tell yourself "I'll think about this at 4pm"
3. At scheduled time (15-30 min), think about worries
4. Problem-solve if actionable
5. Let go if not actionable

Why it works:
- Prevents rumination from derailing day
- Gives worries attention (so brain can let go)
- Most worries feel less urgent when scheduled

Key: Actually do the worry time
Otherwise brain won't trust the system
```

**Values clarification:**
```
Stress often from misalignment with values

Exercise:
1. List your core values (family, health, creativity, etc.)
2. Assess current life alignment
3. Identify mismatches (source of stress)
4. Make adjustments to align better

Example:
Value: Family time
Reality: Working 70 hours/week
Stress: Constant guilt and exhaustion
Adjustment: Set boundaries, delegate, prioritize

Clarity reduces decision stress
Alignment reduces chronic stress
```

### Environmental stress reduction:

**Reduce decision fatigue:**
```
Problem: Hundreds of decisions daily drain willpower

Solutions:
- Routines (morning, evening, work)
- Meal prep or repeat meals
- Capsule wardrobe
- Default yes/no rules
- Batch similar decisions

Automate or eliminate where possible
Save mental energy for what matters
```

**Digital boundaries:**
```
Technology = major stressor

Strategies:
- No phone first hour of morning
- No screens 1 hour before bed
- Turn off most notifications
- Designated phone-free time
- Email batching (not constant checking)
- Social media limits (or elimination)

Information overload is stress
Comparison trap is stress
FOMO is stress

Boundaries protect mental space
```

**Workspace optimization:**
```
Environment affects stress:
- Clutter = cognitive load
- Natural light = mood boost
- Plants = stress reduction
- Personalization = comfort

Physical space matters
Control what you can
```

**Sleep (foundation):**
```
Poor sleep = stress amplifier
Good sleep = stress buffer

Priority #1 for mental health
See sleep-optimization.md for details

7-9 hours, consistent schedule
Non-negotiable for wellbeing
```

---

## Anxiety Management

### Understanding anxiety:

**Normal vs disorder:**
```
Normal anxiety:
- Proportional to threat
- Temporary
- Manageable
- Improves performance (up to a point)

Anxiety disorder:
- Excessive, disproportionate
- Persistent
- Impairs functioning
- Avoidance behaviors

Spectrum, not binary
Professional help if impairing life
```

**Physical symptoms:**
```
Common manifestations:
- Racing heart
- Shortness of breath
- Muscle tension
- Sweating
- Nausea, stomach issues
- Dizziness
- Chest tightness

These are anxiety, not danger
Uncomfortable but not harmful
Understanding this reduces fear of symptoms
```

**Anxiety cycle:**
```
Trigger → Anxious thought → Physical symptoms →
Interpret symptoms as danger → More anxiety →
Avoidance → Temporary relief → Stronger anxiety next time

Breaking this cycle is treatment
```

### Cognitive techniques (CBT):

**Thought challenging:**
```
Process:
1. Identify anxious thought
2. What's the evidence for it?
3. What's the evidence against it?
4. What's the worst that could happen?
5. How likely is that really?
6. What's a more balanced thought?

Example:
Thought: "I'll have a panic attack at the party"
Challenge: "I've been to parties before without panic attacks. Even if I feel anxious, it passes. Most people feel some social anxiety."
Balanced: "I might feel uncomfortable, but I can handle it"

Not dismissing concerns
But evaluating them rationally
```

**Probability estimation:**
```
Anxiety overestimates threat likelihood

Exercise:
1. What am I worried will happen?
2. What's the actual probability (0-100%)?
3. What's my anxiety telling me the probability is?
4. Gap between these = anxiety distortion

Example:
Worry: "I'll lose my job"
Anxiety says: 80% chance
Reality: 10% chance (based on performance, company situation)

Seeing the gap reduces anxiety
```

**Decatastrophizing:**
```
Anxiety jumps to worst-case scenario

Questions:
1. What's the worst that could happen?
2. How would I cope if that happened?
3. What's the most likely outcome?
4. What's the best outcome?

Anxiety focuses on #1
Reality is usually #3
Recognizing coping ability (#2) reduces fear
```

### Behavioral techniques:

**Exposure (gradual):**
```
Avoidance maintains anxiety
Exposure reduces it

Process:
1. Create anxiety hierarchy (0-10 scale)
2. Start with low-anxiety situation (3-4)
3. Stay in situation until anxiety reduces (habituation)
4. Repeat until comfortable
5. Move to next level

Example (social anxiety):
- Level 3: Text someone
- Level 5: Phone call
- Level 7: Coffee with one friend
- Level 9: Small group gathering

Key: Don't escape when anxious
Allow habituation to occur
Build confidence through experience

Professional guidance helpful for exposure therapy
```

**Interoceptive exposure:**
```
For panic: Anxiety about physical sensations

Process:
1. Deliberately induce feared sensations (safely)
   - Hyperventilate (shortness of breath)
   - Spin in chair (dizziness)
   - Tense muscles (tension)
2. Notice sensations without catastrophizing
3. Learn they're uncomfortable but not dangerous
4. Reduce fear of sensations

Why it works:
- Breaks association: sensation = danger
- Builds tolerance
- Reduces panic about panic

Do with therapist guidance initially
```

**Activity scheduling:**
```
Anxiety causes avoidance
Avoidance increases anxiety

Counter-strategy:
1. Schedule activities in advance
2. Commit regardless of how you feel
3. Notice anxiety reduces during/after
4. Build momentum

Start small:
- Short activities
- Low-anxiety situations
- Build gradually

Action precedes motivation
Opposite of "wait until I feel like it"
```

**Grounding techniques (5-4-3-2-1):**
```
For acute anxiety or panic:

Identify:
- 5 things you can see
- 4 things you can touch
- 3 things you can hear
- 2 things you can smell
- 1 thing you can taste

Why it works:
- Anchors you in present moment
- Disrupts anxiety spiral
- Engages sensory system
- Reminds brain you're safe

Use when: Panic attack, dissociation, acute anxiety
```

### Lifestyle factors:

**Caffeine:**
```
Stimulant = anxiety amplifier

Effects:
- Increased heart rate
- Jitteriness
- Sleep disruption
- Mimics anxiety symptoms

For anxiety-prone:
- Reduce or eliminate
- Max 100-200mg/day
- None after noon
- Notice your threshold

Some people very sensitive
Worth experimenting
```

**Alcohol:**
```
Paradox: Reduces anxiety short-term, increases long-term

Problems:
- Rebound anxiety next day
- Sleep disruption
- Dependence risk
- Interferes with therapy/medication

If using alcohol to manage anxiety:
- Warning sign
- Seek other strategies
- Consider professional help

Not a solution, often makes it worse
```

**Blood sugar:**
```
Hypoglycemia mimics anxiety

Prevention:
- Regular meals (don't skip)
- Protein + complex carbs
- Avoid sugar spikes/crashes
- Snacks if needed

Stable blood sugar = stable mood
See nutrition-system.md
```

**Exercise:**
```
Powerful anxiety treatment

Benefits:
- Reduces physical tension
- Metabolizes stress hormones
- Improves sleep
- Builds confidence
- Provides exposure (to elevated heart rate, etc.)

Type: Any consistent movement
Frequency: Most days
Intensity: Moderate (not exhausting)

Acute: Reduces current anxiety
Chronic: Builds resilience
```

## Depression Management

### Understanding depression:

**Symptoms:**
```
Emotional:
- Persistent sadness or emptiness
- Loss of interest in activities
- Irritability
- Feelings of worthlessness
- Hopelessness about future

Physical:
- Fatigue, low energy
- Sleep changes (insomnia or hypersomnia)
- Appetite changes (up or down)
- Psychomotor changes (agitation or slowing)

Cognitive:
- Difficulty concentrating
- Memory problems
- Negative thinking patterns

Duration: 2+ weeks for diagnosis
Severity: Mild, moderate, severe

Not just "feeling down"
A medical condition requiring treatment
```

**Depression cycle:**
```
Low mood → Reduced activity → Less pleasure/accomplishment →
Lower mood → More withdrawal → Deeper depression

Inactivity maintains depression
Activity breaks the cycle
This is basis of behavioral activation
```

### Behavioral activation:

**Activity scheduling:**
```
Core depression treatment

Problem: Depression says "I don't feel like it"
Reality: Action precedes motivation

Process:
1. List activities (previously enjoyed or necessary)
2. Rate: Pleasure (P) and Accomplishment (A) 1-10
3. Schedule activities regardless of mood
4. Do activities even if don't feel like it
5. Rate actual P and A after
6. Notice: Predicted < Actual often

Key: Do it anyway
Waiting for motivation = staying stuck
```

**Break tasks into small steps:**
```
Depression makes everything feel overwhelming

Solution: Tiny steps

Example:
Big task: "Clean the house"
Overwhelming

Small steps:
1. Put one dish in dishwasher
2. Wipe one counter
3. Take out one bag of trash

First step is hardest
Momentum builds
Any action > no action
```

**Opposite action:**
```
Depression urges:
- Stay in bed → Get up
- Isolate → Reach out
- Avoid activities → Do activities
- Ruminate → Engage with external world

Opposite action principle:
When depressed, your instincts work against you
Do the opposite of what depression tells you

Difficult but effective
```

**Social connection (despite not wanting to):**
```
Depression isolates
Isolation worsens depression

Solution: Connection even when hard

Strategies:
- Schedule social time in advance
- Start small (text, phone call)
- Be honest ("I'm struggling but wanted to connect")
- Lower the bar (coffee, walk, not big event)

Quality connections = treatment
Not burden, necessary intervention
```

### Cognitive techniques:

**Thought records:**
```
Track negative automatic thoughts

Columns:
1. Situation
2. Automatic thought
3. Evidence for thought
4. Evidence against thought
5. Alternative thought
6. Mood rating (before and after)

Example:
Situation: Friend didn't text back
Thought: "They hate me, I'm worthless"
Evidence for: Can't think of any solid evidence
Evidence against: They've been busy, texted yesterday, invited me out last week
Alternative: "They're probably busy, not everything is about me"
Mood: 8/10 → 5/10

Not positive thinking
Realistic, balanced thinking
```

**Identifying cognitive distortions:**
```
Common in depression:

All-or-nothing: "I'm a complete failure"
Overgeneralization: "Nothing ever works out"
Mental filter: Focus only on negatives
Discounting positives: "That doesn't count"
Jumping to conclusions: Mind reading, fortune telling
Magnification: Blowing things out of proportion
Emotional reasoning: "I feel bad, therefore I am bad"
Should statements: "I should be doing better"
Labeling: "I'm worthless" vs "I made a mistake"
Personalization: Everything is your fault

Recognition is first step
Challenge with evidence
```

**Gratitude practice:**
```
Not toxic positivity
But attention training

Practice:
- 3 things daily you're grateful for
- Be specific (not generic)
- Savor the feeling
- Write them down

Why it works:
- Trains attention to positive
- Depression filters out positive
- Doesn't deny negative
- Balanced perspective

Best time: Morning or before bed
Takes: 2 minutes
Consistency: Daily practice
```

### Lifestyle interventions:

**Sleep regulation:**
```
Critical for depression

Common patterns:
- Insomnia (can't sleep)
- Hypersomnia (sleeping too much)
- Irregular schedule

Both: Worsen depression

Fix:
- Consistent wake time (even weekends)
- 7-9 hours target
- Good sleep hygiene
- Light exposure in morning
- Dark, cool room at night

See sleep-optimization.md
Sleep regulation alone can significantly improve mood
```

**Exercise (as powerful as medication):**
```
Research: Exercise = antidepressant

Effects:
- Increases neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine)
- Stimulates neurogenesis
- Reduces inflammation
- Improves sleep
- Builds self-efficacy

Recommended:
- 30-45 minutes, most days
- Moderate intensity (brisk walk is enough)
- Outdoors if possible (sunlight bonus)
- With others if possible (social bonus)

Hardest when depressed (low motivation)
Most helpful when depressed
Start tiny, build gradually
```

**Light exposure:**
```
Especially for seasonal pattern

Morning sunlight:
- 10-30 minutes outside
- Within 1-2 hours of waking
- Even cloudy day helps

Light therapy box:
- 10,000 lux
- 30 minutes in morning
- For seasonal affective disorder

Mechanism:
- Regulates circadian rhythm
- Increases serotonin
- Reduces melatonin during day

Simple, effective, underused
```

**Nutrition:**
```
Diet affects mood

Mediterranean diet:
- Anti-inflammatory
- Omega-3s (fish)
- Whole foods
- Minimal processed food

What to emphasize:
- Fatty fish (omega-3)
- Vegetables, fruits
- Whole grains
- Lean proteins

What to minimize:
- High sugar
- Processed foods
- Excessive alcohol

Not cure, but supporting factor
See nutrition-system.md
```

### When to seek professional help:

**Red flags:**
```
Immediate help needed:
☐ Thoughts of harming others
☐ Severe inability to function
☐ Psychotic symptoms
☐ Severe self-harm

Don't minimize serious symptoms
```

**Professional help recommended:**
```
☐ Depression lasting >2 weeks
☐ Interfering with work/relationships
☐ Self-care suffering significantly
☐ Not responding to self-help
☐ Co-occurring substance use
☐ Severe symptoms

Therapy (especially CBT, IPT, behavioral activation)
Medication (SSRIs, SNRIs)
Often combination most effective

Not failure to need help
Professional intervention = effective treatment
```

---

## Building Resilience

### Components of resilience:

**Psychological flexibility:**
```
Definition: Adapt to changing situations
Key skills:
- Accept what can't be changed
- Commit to values-based action
- Be present in the moment
- Self-as-observer (not identified with thoughts)

Opposite: Rigidity, avoidance, fusion with thoughts

Flexible people recover faster
Adapt to adversity better
```

**Growth mindset:**
```
Fixed: "I'm not good at this"
Growth: "I'm not good at this yet"

Beliefs:
- Abilities can be developed
- Effort leads to growth
- Challenges are opportunities
- Failure is feedback

Impact on resilience:
- Less threatened by challenges
- Persist through difficulty
- Learn from setbacks
```

**Self-compassion:**
```
Not self-esteem (I'm better than others)
But: Treat yourself as you'd treat a friend

Components:
1. Self-kindness (not self-criticism)
2. Common humanity (everyone struggles)
3. Mindfulness (awareness without judgment)

Practice:
- Notice self-critical thoughts
- What would you tell a friend?
- Speak to yourself that way

Research: Self-compassion > self-esteem
For resilience, motivation, wellbeing
```

**Purpose and meaning:**
```
Why it matters:
- Gives context to suffering
- Motivates through difficulty
- Provides direction
- Creates resilience

Finding meaning:
- What do you value?
- What would you like to contribute?
- What legacy do you want?
- What helps you transcend self?

Doesn't need to be grand
Small daily purpose works
```

### Resilience practices:

**Regular stress exposure:**
```
Antifragile principle: Grow stronger from stress

Examples:
- Cold exposure (cold showers)
- Exercise (controlled physical stress)
- Social challenges (public speaking)
- Cognitive challenges (learning difficult things)

Key: Manageable doses
Recovery between exposures
Builds adaptation capacity

Avoiding all stress = fragility
Overwhelming stress = breakdown
Optimal stress = growth
```

**Reflection practices:**
```
Journaling:
- Process experiences
- Track patterns
- Problem-solve
- Express emotions

Formats:
- Morning pages (stream of consciousness)
- Evening reflection (what went well/what learned)
- Gratitude journal
- Thought records

Benefit: External processing
Clarity, pattern recognition
Emotional regulation
```

**Regular downtime:**
```
Constant productivity = burnout

Need for recovery:
- Rest is productive
- Creativity needs space
- Reflection requires quiet
- Nervous system needs breaks

Schedule:
- Daily: Quiet time, walks, hobbies
- Weekly: Day off from work
- Quarterly: Longer break

Not luxury, necessity
Prevents rather than treats burnout
```

**Strong relationships:**
```
Best predictor of wellbeing

Quality indicators:
- Mutual support
- Vulnerability and trust
- Shared values
- Regular contact
- Reciprocity

Invest in:
- Existing relationships (maintain)
- New relationships (expand)
- Repairing conflicts
- Showing up

Isolation = risk factor
Connection = protective factor
```

---

## Specific Interventions

### Mindfulness meditation:

**What it is:**
```
Paying attention to present moment
Without judgment
With openness and curiosity

Not:
- Stopping thoughts
- Relaxation (though that may happen)
- Religious (though has roots in Buddhism)

Is:
- Training attention
- Observing thoughts/feelings
- Developing awareness
```

**How to practice:**
```
Basic mindfulness:
1. Sit comfortably, eyes closed
2. Focus on breath (sensation of breathing)
3. When mind wanders (it will), notice
4. Gently return attention to breath
5. Repeat for 10-20 minutes

The wandering IS the practice
Noticing and returning builds attention
Like reps at gym for brain
```

**Benefits (research-backed):**
```
Mental:
- Reduced anxiety and depression
- Better emotional regulation
- Decreased rumination
- Improved focus and attention

Physical:
- Lower cortisol
- Reduced inflammation
- Better immune function
- Lower blood pressure

Brain changes:
- Increased gray matter (attention, compassion areas)
- Decreased amygdala reactivity
- Better prefrontal cortex function

Takes: 8 weeks of daily practice to see changes
Dose: 10-20 minutes daily
```

**Types:**
```
Focused attention: Concentrate on breath, body, sound
Open monitoring: Notice whatever arises
Loving-kindness: Cultivate compassion
Body scan: Systematic attention to body parts

Start with focused attention
Expand to other types
```

### Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):

**Core model:**
```
Situation → Thoughts → Feelings → Behaviors

Example:
Situation: Presentation at work
Thought: "I'll mess up and look stupid"
Feeling: Anxiety
Behavior: Avoid preparing, perform poorly

vs

Situation: Presentation at work
Thought: "I'm prepared, I can handle this"
Feeling: Manageable nerves
Behavior: Prepare well, perform adequately

Change thoughts → Change feelings/behaviors
```

**Key techniques:**
```
1. Cognitive restructuring
   - Identify automatic thoughts
   - Challenge with evidence
   - Generate alternative thoughts

2. Behavioral experiments
   - Test predictions
   - Gather evidence
   - Update beliefs

3. Exposure
   - Face fears gradually
   - Habituate to anxiety
   - Build confidence

4. Activity scheduling
   - Plan activities in advance
   - Do regardless of mood
   - Track pleasure/accomplishment
```

**Self-directed CBT:**
```
Resources:
- Feeling Good (David Burns)
- Mind Over Mood (Greenberger & Padesky)
- Online programs (MoodGym, Beating the Blues)

Can be effective for mild-moderate issues
Therapist-guided better for severe
```

### Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT):

**Core principles:**
```
Psychological flexibility through:

1. Acceptance: Allow uncomfortable thoughts/feelings
   (vs avoidance or suppression)

2. Cognitive defusion: Thoughts are thoughts, not facts
   (vs fusion: believing all thoughts)

3. Present moment: Be here now
   (vs ruminating past or worrying future)

4. Self-as-context: You are not your thoughts
   (vs self-as-content: "I am anxious")

5. Values: What matters to you?
   (vs goals: what you want to achieve)

6. Committed action: Act on values
   (vs inaction or values-inconsistent behavior)

Different from CBT:
CBT: Change thoughts
ACT: Change relationship with thoughts
```

**Defusion techniques:**
```
Problem: Fusion with thoughts
"I'm worthless" → Feels like truth

Defusion:
"I'm having the thought that I'm worthless"
→ Just a thought, not truth

Techniques:
- Add "I'm noticing I'm having the thought that..."
- Say thought in silly voice
- Thank your mind for the thought
- Imagine thoughts as leaves floating down stream

Goal: Reduce impact of unhelpful thoughts
Not eliminate them
```

## Red Flags - Seek Immediate Help:

```

### When to see a therapist:

```

```

### When to consider medication:

```
Recommended for:
- Moderate to severe depression
- Severe anxiety/panic
- Not responding to therapy alone
- Previous good response to medication
- Preference for medication

Common medications:
- SSRIs (Prozac, Zoloft, Lexapro)
- SNRIs (Effexor, Cymbalta)
- Atypicals (Wellbutrin, Mirtazapine)
- Benzodiazepines (short-term anxiety only)

Myths to debunk:
✗ "Medication changes who you are" - No, treats illness
✗ "It's a crutch" - No, it's treatment
✗ "You should just tough it out" - No, seek help
✗ "You'll be on it forever" - Maybe not, discuss with doctor

Reality: Medication helps many people
Combined with therapy often most effective
No shame in medication
