## Schedule Generation Process

### 1. Determine Scope
- Platform(s)
- Timeframe
- Frequency preferences
- Any specific topics/events

### 2. Calculate Distribution
Based on timeframe and frequency, calculate how many posts per category:

Example for 1 week of X (14 posts):
- AI creativity: 3 posts (21%)
- Productivity: 3 posts (21%)
- Product design: 2 posts (14%)
- Technology: 1 post (7%)
- Other categories: 5 posts (37%)

### 3. Assign Post Times
Space posts optimally:
- Different times each day
- Peak engagement windows
- Avoid clustering

### 4. Generate Content
For each scheduled slot:
- Choose content type
- Write actual post
- Include formatting
- Add any visual notes

### 5. Balance Variety
Ensure mix of:
- Content types (insight, story, tip, etc.)
- Tones (serious, casual, provocative)
- Formats (single, thread, carousel)
- Media (text, image, video)

## Content Type Rotation

**X/Twitter weekly rotation:**
- Monday: Framework/system
- Tuesday: Tool/resource
- Wednesday: Thread (main content)
- Thursday: Personal story
- Friday: Quick tip
- Saturday: Casual thought
- Sunday: Thread or rest day

**LinkedIn weekly rotation:**
- Tuesday: Insight post
- Wednesday: Story post
- Thursday: Framework/list post
- (Or pick 2 of these)

**Instagram weekly rotation:**
- Monday: Tool showcase
- Tuesday: AI art
- Wednesday: Project highlight
- Thursday: Tip/insight
- Friday: Behind the scenes
- Weekend: Community question

## Special Considerations

**Trending topics:**
- Reserve 1-2 slots per week for timely content
- Can replace scheduled posts
- Note: "Flex slot for trending topic"

**Product launches:**
- Multi-platform coordination
- Same day/time across platforms
- Adjusted versions per platform

**Personal updates:**
- Mix into regular schedule
- Don't cluster
- Balance with value content

## Schedule Flexibility

**Rigid elements:**
- Overall topic distribution
- Minimum posting frequency
- General time windows

**Flexible elements:**
- Exact post times
- Content type mix
- Specific topics
- Format variations

## Output Format

```markdown
# [Platform] Content Calendar
## [Timeframe]

### [Day, Date]
**[Time]** - [Content Type]
Topic: [Category]
Format: [Single/Thread/Carousel/etc]

[Full content ready to post]

## Schedule Maintenance

**Daily:**

- Confirm timing still optimal

**Weekly:**
- Review engagement on past posts
- Adjust future timing if needed
- Plan next week's content

**Monthly:**
- Analyze topic performance
- Refine distribution percentages
- Update optimal posting times

## Quick Commands

**"X schedule for this week"**
→ Generate 7-day X posting calendar

**"LinkedIn posts for this month"**
→ Generate monthly LinkedIn schedule

**"Full social schedule this week"**
→ All platforms, 7 days

**"Just give me today's posts"**
→ Single day, all relevant platforms

## Integration with Research

Schedule generation should:
- Pull from topic research
- Include trending topics in flex slots
- Balance evergreen and timely content
- Reference recent findings

## Quality Checks

Before finalizing schedule:
- [ ] Topic distribution matches percentages
- [ ] Times are optimal for timezone
- [ ] Content variety is good
- [ ] Each post provides value
- [ ] Voice is consistent
- [ ] No repetitive patterns
- [ ] Flex slots marked for trending
- [ ] All content is complete (not just placeholders)

## Next Steps

Ready to generate a schedule? Specify:
- Platform(s)?
- Timeframe (day/week/month)?
- Any specific topics to include?
- Standard frequency or custom?

I'll create a complete, ready-to-use content calendar with all posts written and optimally scheduled.
