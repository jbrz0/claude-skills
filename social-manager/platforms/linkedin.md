# LinkedIn Content Generation

Generate professional, insightful LinkedIn posts that establish thought leadership and build meaningful connections.

## Platform Specs

- **Character limit**: 3000 (but optimal is 1300 for feed display)

- **Optimal posting times** (Bangkok timezone):
  - Tuesday-Thursday: 7:00-9:00 AM
  - Wednesday: 12:00 PM (highest engagement)
  - Avoid: Weekends, late evenings

## Content Types

### Insight Post
Share a professional observation or lesson. Most common format.

**Structure:**
```
[Hook - bold statement or question]

[Context - brief setup]

[Insight - the actual value]

[Supporting points with line breaks]

[Conclusion or takeaway]

[Optional CTA - question to engage]
```

**Example:**
```
After 5 years building design systems, I've learned something counterintuitive:

The best design systems aren't the most comprehensive.
They're the most adopted.

Here's what actually matters:

→ Documentation that people actually read
→ Components that solve real problems
→ Guidelines that make decisions easier, not harder

A "perfect" system nobody uses is worse than a "good enough" system everyone adopts.

What's been your experience with design systems?
```

### Story Post
Personal narrative with professional lesson.

**Structure:**
```
[Set the scene]

[The challenge/mistake]

[What happened]

[The lesson]

[How others can apply it]
```

**Example:**
```
3 months ago, I quit my job to build a product.

Smart move, right?

Wrong.

Three months in:
- No users
- No revenue
- Hemorrhaging savings

My wife: "Maybe get a job?"
Me: "Just one more month..."

That month: First paying customer.

Not because my app got better.
Because I finally asked: "What do you actually need?"

Turns out I was building MY dream.
Not THEIR solution.

Lesson:

Fall in love with the problem.
Not your solution.

Your first idea will probably be wrong.
That's okay.

Just make sure you can afford to find out.

Anyone else learning this lesson the hard way?

### List/Framework Post
Structured insights or tips.

**Structure:**
```
[Intro - why this matters]

[Numbered list with explanations]

[Conclusion - how to apply]
```

**Example:**
```
5 signs your design is over-engineered:

1. Users need a tutorial to understand it
→ Good design is intuitive, not impressive

2. Every interaction has 3 steps
→ Friction kills adoption

3. You have more features than users
→ Complexity for its own sake

4. The team spends more time maintaining than shipping
→ Technical debt with no user benefit

5. You're proud of it, but users don't care
→ The best design is invisible

The goal isn't to showcase your skills.
It's to solve problems people actually have.

**Question:**
"Why do we still [common inefficiency]?"

**Story:**
"3 years ago, I [relatable struggle]."

### Engagement Tactics

**Questions that work:**
