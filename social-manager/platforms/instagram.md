# Instagram Content Generation

Generate visual-first Instagram content that's scannable, engaging, and community-focused.

## Platform Specs

- **Caption limit**: 2200 characters
- **Optimal caption**: 150-200 characters (3 punchy bullets)
- **Hashtags**: 5-10 relevant, placed in first comment
- **Optimal posting times** (Bangkok timezone):
  - Weekdays: 12:00-1:00 PM, 7:00-9:00 PM
  - Weekends: 11:00 AM-12:00 PM

## Content Types

### Visual Post
Single image with concise caption. Most common format.

**Structure:**
```
[Visual]
↓
[Hook line]

✦ [Point 1]
✦ [Point 2]
✦ [Point 3]

[Optional CTA]
```

**Example:**
```
[Cyberpunk city aesthetic image]

Why I build in dark mode:

✦ Less eye strain = longer sessions
✦ Better battery life on OLED
✦ Looks objectively cooler

What's your setup preference?
```

### Carousel Post
Multiple images telling a story or showing progression.

**Structure:**
```
Slide 1: Hook/Title
Slide 2-3: Main content
Slide 4: Conclusion/CTA
```

**Example:**
```
[Slide 1: "5 Design Systems Mistakes"]
[Slide 2: "1. Over-documenting"]
[Slide 3: "2. Under-using"]
[Slide 4: "3. No adoption plan"]
[Slide 5: "What to do instead →"]
```

### Reel/Video
Short video with text overlay and trending audio.

**Caption structure:**
```
[Hook question or statement]

[Quick value prop]

[CTA to engage]
```

## Caption Formula

**The 3-Bullet System:**
```
[Attention-grabbing first line]

✦ [Quick insight 1]
✦ [Quick insight 2]  
✦ [Quick insight 3]

[Optional question/CTA]
```

**Why it works:**
- Scannable on mobile
- Easy to read quickly
- Visually clean
- High engagement

## Voice Guidelines

**Tone:**
- Energetic but not overly enthusiastic
- Personal and authentic
- Community-focused
- Encouraging without toxic positivity

**Style:**

- Line breaks for readability
- Strategic caps for EMPHASIS

**What NOT to do:**
- Long-winded captions
- Wall of hashtags in caption
- Engagement bait
- Generic motivational quotes
- "Tag a friend who..."
- Overuse of emojis

## Visual Content Strategy
