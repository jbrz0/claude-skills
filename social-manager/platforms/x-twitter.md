# X/Twitter Content Generation

Generate engaging, authentic X/Twitter posts and threads that drive conversation and build audience.

## Platform Specs

- **Character limit**: 280 characters per tweet
- **Thread length**: 3-5 tweets (occasionally longer if necessary)
- **Optimal posting times** (Bangkok timezone):
  - Morning: 7:00-9:00 AM
  - Lunch: 12:00-1:00 PM
  - Evening: 6:00-8:00 PM
  - Night: 9:00-11:00 PM

## Content Types

### Single Tweet
Short, punchy observation or insight. Most common format.

**Example:**
```
AI won't replace designers.

Designers who ignore AI will be replaced by designers who leverage it.

The tool doesn't matter.
The thinking does.
```

### Thread
Multi-tweet story or breakdown. Use for complex ideas or narratives.

**Structure:**
1. Hook (grab attention)
2. Context (set up problem/idea)
3. Insights (deliver value)
4. Conclusion (tie it together)
5. CTA (optional - question or next step)

**Example:**
```
Thread 1/5:
Everyone talks about "building in public."

Nobody talks about what happens when you build and nobody shows up.

Here's what 6 months of public building actually looks like:

Thread 2/5:
Month 1: Excited to share progress
Engagement: 3 likes, 0 replies
Reality check: Building isn't the same as marketing

Thread 3/5:

```

## Voice Guidelines

**Tone:**
- Conversational (like talking to a smart friend)
- Confident but not arrogant
- Direct and honest
- Occasionally provocative (but never trolling)

**Style:**
- Short sentences
- Line breaks for emphasis
- No en/em dashes (use hyphens only)
- Minimal punctuation
- Strategic caps for EMPHASIS

**What NOT to do:**
- Generic motivational quotes
- Hashtag spam
- Obvious engagement bait ("Agree?" "Repost if...")
- Corporate speak
- AI tells ("Excited to announce...")

## Content Strategies

### Hook Patterns

**Contrarian:**
"Everyone says X. Here's why they're wrong."

**Personal story:**
"I made a $50k mistake last year. Here's what I learned."

**Bold claim:**
"The design system revolution is a lie."

**Pattern interrupt:**
"Stop asking for feedback. Start asking for money."

**Question:**
"Why do we call it 'productivity' when it's really just delayed burnout?"

### Thread Structures

**List/Framework:**
```
5 things I wish I knew before building my first SaaS:

1. [Point]
2. [Point]
3. [Point]
4. [Point]
5. [Point]
```

**Story arc:**
```
Beginning: Where I started
Middle: What went wrong
End: What I learned
Takeaway: What you should do
```

**Problem-Solution:**
```
The problem: [Common pain point]
Why it happens: [Root cause]
What to do instead: [Solution]
How to start: [First step]
```

## Engagement Tips

**Questions that work:**
- "What's your take?"
- "Anyone else experience this?"
- "Which would you choose?"

**Questions that don't:**
- "Agree or disagree?" (too generic)
- "Thoughts?" (lazy)
- "What do you think?" (vague)

**Reply strategy:**
- Reply to ALL comments in first hour
- Ask follow-up questions
- Quote tweet interesting responses
- Don't just say "thanks" - add value

## Visual Assets

**When to include images:**
- Screenshots of tools/interfaces
- Simple data visualizations
- Before/after comparisons
- Memes (sparingly)
- Your own creative work

**Midjourney prompts** (when relevant):
Request visual generation guidance for cyberpunk/futuristic aesthetic that matches your brand.

## Topic Distribution

Balance content across categories:
- Creativity in AI (20%)
- Productivity/automation (20%)
- Product design (15%)
- Tech/hardware (10%)
- UI/UX (5%)
- Web dev (5%)
- Cyberpunk (5%)
- Business (5%)
- Health/wellness (5%)
- Minimalism (5%)
- Investing/crypto (5%)

## Common Formats

### Observation
```
The best UI is invisible.

The best code is deleted.

The best design is boring.

Mastery isn't complexity.
It's clarity.
```

### Contrarian Take
```
Hot take:

Your "MVP" isn't minimal.
It's just incomplete.

Minimal means necessary.
Not rushed.
```

### Personal Insight
```
Spent 3 months building features nobody asked for.

Then spent 3 days building what they actually needed.

Guess which one got traction?

Talk to users before you write code.
```

### Resource Share
```

Free tier is generous.
Paid tier is worth it.
