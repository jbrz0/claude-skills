## Strategic Framework

### Vision
Build the most efficient design agency in the world - delivering Fortune 500 quality at startup speed, powered by human creativity + AI execution.

### Mission
Help small tech startups compete with visual and product design that punches above their weight. Make world-class design accessible to teams with limited budgets and tight timelines.

### Values
- **Speed**: Ship fast, iterate faster
- **Quality**: No compromises on craft
- **Efficiency**: Automate the boring, focus on the creative
- **Transparency**: Clear pricing, clear timelines, clear communication
- **Impact**: Design should drive business results, not just look pretty

## Target Market Analysis

### Ideal Client Profile (ICP)

**Primary ICP: Early-Stage Tech Startup**
- **Stage**: Pre-seed to Series A
- **Team size**: 2-15 people
- **Funding**: $500k-$5M raised
- **Verticals**: Web3, AI/ML, SaaS, DeFi, developer tools
- **Pain points**: 
  - Need professional design but can't afford agency retainers
  - Moving too fast for traditional agency timelines
  - In-house design hire too expensive or slow
  - Need full brand + product design, not piecemeal
- **Budget**: $10k-30k for design work
- **Decision maker**: Founder or head of product
- **Timeline pressure**: Raising next round, launching product, attending conference

**Secondary ICP: Solo Founder / Small Product Team**
- **Stage**: Bootstrapped or just raised pre-seed
- **Team size**: 1-5 people
- **Budget**: $5k-15k
- **Need**: MVP design, brand identity to look credible
- **Timeline**: Even tighter (weeks not months)

**Tertiary ICP: Growth-Stage Startup (Selective)**
- **Stage**: Series A-B
- **Need**: Rebrand, product redesign, design system overhaul
- **Budget**: $15k-50k+
- **Why selective**: Longer sales cycles, more stakeholders, potential scope creep
- **When to take**: Repeat clients, great fit, premium pricing

### Market Segments

**Tier 1 (Core Focus):**
- AI/ML startups (LLM tools, AI agents, ML platforms)
- Web3 projects (DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, crypto infrastructure)
- Developer tools (APIs, platforms, SaaS for devs)

**Tier 2 (Opportunistic):**
- Vertical SaaS (fintech, healthtech, edtech)
- Productivity tools (collaboration, project management)
- Consumer apps (social, content, creator tools)

**Tier 3 (Avoid Unless Premium):**
- Enterprise software (long sales cycles)
- Agencies/consultancies (low margins, complex projects)
- E-commerce brands (different skill set needed)
- Non-tech businesses (not the vibe)

### Geographic Focus

**Primary**: United States (payment ease, timezone overlap)
**Secondary**: Europe (good clients, workable timezones)
**Opportunistic**: Asia/Pacific (if project fits and client is easy to work with)

Remote-first, so location doesn't matter except for timezone coordination and payment logistics.

## Competitive Analysis

### Direct Competitors (Productized Design Agencies)

**Similar model agencies:**
- Design Joy ($5k-15k/month retainer, queue-based)
- Metacraft ($10k-20k packages, longer timelines)
- Various small studios with fixed packages

**Our advantages:**
- Faster delivery (2 weeks vs 4-8 weeks)
- More comprehensive (brand + product + collateral)
- Tech-native (understand Web3/AI deeply)
- AI-augmented (can move faster without compromising quality)

**Their advantages:**
- More established (social proof, case studies)
- Larger team (can handle bigger projects)
- Specialized expertise in specific areas

### Indirect Competitors

**Traditional agencies:**
- Pros: Full service, experienced teams
- Cons: Slow (months), expensive ($50k-200k+), overkill for startups
- Our angle: "80% of the quality, 20% of the cost, 4x the speed"

**Freelance designers:**
- Pros: Cheap ($3k-8k), flexible
- Cons: Variable quality, scope management issues, piecemeal approach
- Our angle: "Agency quality, freelance speed, fixed pricing"

**In-house design hire:**
- Pros: Full-time resource, knows company deeply
- Cons: $100k+ salary, takes months to hire, one person's skill limits
- Our angle: "Get a full team's output for 1/10th the annual cost"

**Design subscription services:**
- Pros: Unlimited requests, flat monthly fee
- Cons: Queue-based (slow), limited to one request at a time, no full projects
- Our angle: "Complete project delivery, not task queue"

### Competitive Positioning

**Positioning statement:**
"Odd Scenes is the design partner for ambitious tech startups who need exceptional brand and product design in weeks, not months - without the agency price tag."

**Key differentiators:**
1. **Speed**: 2-week delivery (vs 4-8 weeks industry standard)
2. **Comprehensive**: Full stack from brand to product to collateral
3. **Tech-native**: We speak your language (Web3, AI, DeFi)
4. **Transparent**: Fixed pricing, clear timeline, no surprises
5. **AI-augmented**: Efficiency without sacrificing craft

**What we're NOT:**
- Not a subscription service (we do projects, not queues)
- Not a freelancer (you get a full team, not one person)
- Not a traditional agency (fast and affordable, not slow and expensive)
- Not a dev shop (we design, not build - though we can bridge)

### Pricing Optimization Path

**Months 1-3**: Stay at $10k
- Build credibility and case studies
- Prove delivery capability
- Get testimonials

**Months 4-6**: Test $11k-12k

### Price Sensitivity Signals

**Can raise prices when:**
- Waitlist of 5+ qualified prospects
- Declining 30%+ of inquiries due to capacity

- Getting referrals without asking
- Industry recognition/awards/features

**Should hold prices when:**
- Close rate drops below 30%

- Leads are mostly unqualified
- No organic demand (only outbound working)

### Discounting Philosophy

**Never discount except:**

- Nonprofits/social impact: Case-by-case, max 20% off
- Repeat clients: Consider loyalty discount (5-10%) or bonus add-ons

**Never negotiate on:**
- Payment terms (50/50 is non-negotiable)
- Timeline (2 weeks delivery, no rush jobs unless +30% premium)
- Scope (package is package, additions cost extra)

## Key Decisions to Make

### Now (Months 1-3)
- **Agency name locked?** Odd Scenes Media vs alternatives
- **Website v1 scope:** DIY or hire someone? Timeline?
- **First client strategy:** Discounted case studies or full price?
- **Niche focus:** Start broad or pick vertical immediately?

### Soon (Months 4-6)
- **Price increase:** When to move from $10k to $12k?
- **Package variations:** Launch Mini ($5k) now or wait?
- **Outbound strategy:** What channels? What volume?
- **Content strategy:** How much time on marketing vs client work?

### Later (Months 7-12)
- **Team expansion:** Stay solo or hire?
- **Niche specialization:** AI, Web3, or stay generalist?
- **Product development:** Templates, courses, or pure service?
- **Geographic expansion:** International clients or US-focused?

## When to Escalate

Surface to user when:
- **Market shift**: Major change in target market or competitive landscape
- **Pricing decision**: Considering price increase or new package pricing
- **Positioning pivot**: Thinking about niche focus or repositioning
- **Capability gaps**: Noticing repeated client requests for skills we don't have
- **Growth opportunities**: Partnership, acquisition, or expansion opportunities
- **Threats**: New competitor, economic downturn, or technology shift
- **Strategic direction**: Decisions about team, product, or business model evolution

## Success Metrics

**Track monthly:**
- Packages delivered (target: 2-3)
- Revenue (target: $20-30k)
- Profit margin (target: 60%+)
- Close rate (target: 40%+)
- Lead volume (target: 10+ qualified/month)

**Track quarterly:**
- Client mix (verticals, size, geography)
- Pricing trends (average deal size, discounting frequency)
- Repeat/referral rate (target: 20%+)
- Capability requests (what are clients asking for that we don't offer?)
- Competitive wins/losses (why did we win/lose deals?)

**Track annually:**
- Revenue growth year-over-year
- Profit margin trend
- Client concentration (how dependent on any single client?)
- Personal satisfaction (am I enjoying this? Burning out?)
- Market position (are we known in our target market?)

## Notes

- **Strategy is fluid**: Re-evaluate quarterly, pivot when needed
- **Focus matters**: Better to dominate a niche than be mediocre everywhere
- **Pricing is positioning**: Don't compete on price, compete on value
- **Say no often**: Not every client is a good client
- **Efficiency enables quality**: Templates and automation free up time for creative work
- **Build in public**: Share the journey, attract like-minded clients
- **Sustainable growth**: Don't sacrifice quality or sanity for revenue
