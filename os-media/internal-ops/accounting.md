## Pricing Guidance

### Standard Package Economics

**$10k Full Package**:
```
Revenue: $10,000
Cost of delivery:
  - Tools/assets: $500
  - Time (70 hrs × $50 cost basis): $3,500
Total costs: $4,000
Gross profit: $6,000
Margin: 60%

After business expenses (~$2k/month allocated):
  - If doing 3 packages/month = $666/package overhead
Net profit per package: ~$5,334
Effective hourly: $76/hr net, $143/hr gross
```

**Target volume**:
- 2-3 packages per month = $20-30k revenue
- Annual: $240-360k revenue
- Net profit: ~$150-200k after all expenses and taxes

### Custom Project Pricing

For work outside standard package:

**Small additions** (<10 hours):
- Bill at $200/hr
- Invoice immediately on completion
- Examples: Extra social templates, additional apparel designs

**Medium projects** (10-40 hours):
- Fixed price: $3,000-8,000
- Payment: 50% upfront, 50% on delivery
- Examples: Website build, additional brand materials

**Large custom** (40+ hours):
- Fixed price: $8,000-20,000+
- Milestone billing: 40% / 30% / 30%
- Examples: Full app design, complex multi-brand projects

### Package Customization Pricing

**Client opts out of deliverables**:
- Don't reduce price (time savings go to quality improvements)
- Or offer modest discount if significant scope reduction (max 15%)
- Example: Client opts out of apparel + stationery = $9,000 instead of $10,000

**Client wants additions**:
- Extra pages: +$500-1,000 each
- Additional brand variations: +$1,000-2,000
- Extra revision rounds: +$1,500/week
- Rush delivery (1 week total): +$3,000 (30% premium)

### Retainer Pricing

**Ongoing maintenance/support**:
- $4,000/month: ~20 hours of support/updates
- $6,000/month: ~30 hours of support/updates
- $8,000/month: ~40 hours or dedicated weekly deliverables

Effective rate: $150-200/hr (vs $167/hr on packages)
Benefit: Predictable monthly revenue

## Tax Management

### Quarterly Estimates

Calculate quarterly tax estimates (15th of April, June, September, January):
```
Profit to date: $X
Estimated annual profit: $Y
Federal tax (24-37%): $A
State tax (0-13%): $B
Self-employment tax (15.3% on first ~$160k): $C

Total estimated tax: $A + $B + $C
Less: Payments made this year
Equals: Quarterly payment due
```

**Example** (for $200k net profit):
```
Federal (24% bracket + marginal rates): $35,000
State (assume 6%): $12,000
Self-employment (15.3%): $24,000
Total annual tax: ~$71,000

Quarterly payment: ~$17,750
```

## When to Escalate

Flag for user when:
- **Cash flow issues**: Less than 2 months runway
- **Late payments**: Invoice >30 days overdue (especially deposits)
- **Package profitability**: Consistently going over 80 hours per package
- **Pricing decisions**: Client requests unusual scope or custom work
- **Tax issues**: Unexpected tax liability, audit, or complicated situations
- **Major expenses**: Large one-time purchases (>$2k)
- **Contract terms**: Client wants unusual payment terms or scope
- **Capacity issues**: Booked more than 3 packages in same month (delivery crunch risk)

## Financial Health Targets

**Monthly:**
- Packages sold: 2-3 (target $20-30k revenue)
- Profit margin: 75%+ (after all expenses, before taxes)
- Invoice collection rate: 100% on deposits, 95%+ on finals within 14 days
- Package delivery time: 12-14 days (beat the 2-week target)

**Annual:**
- Revenue: $240-360k (2-3 packages/month)
- Net profit: $150-200k (after all expenses and taxes)
- Packages delivered: 24-36
- Client retention: 30%+ repeat/referral rate
- Cash reserve: 3-6 months expenses

**Per package:**
- Profit margin: 60%+ (after direct costs)
- Actual hours: 60-80 hours (if consistently over, raise prices)
- Client satisfaction: On-time delivery, minimal scope creep

## Package Profitability Tracking

Track these metrics per package to optimize:
- **Time investment**: Actual hours vs target
- **Most time-consuming**: Which deliverables take longest
- **Least valuable**: Which deliverables clients skip most
- **Profitable add-ons**: What do clients request that we should productize

**Monthly review questions**:
- Are we hitting 60-80 hour target per package?
- Which deliverables should we streamline with templates?
- Should we adjust what's included in standard package?
- Are there patterns in opt-outs? (Maybe remove from standard offering)
- What add-ons should we formalize with set pricing?

## Notes

- This is a **productized service model** - standardized package, predictable pricing
- **Deposit is non-negotiable** - never start work without 50% upfront
- **Final payment before revisions** - if client doesn't pay, pause revision work after 7 days
- **Volume over margin** - 2-3 packages per month at 60% margin beats 1 package at 80% margin
- **Optimize delivery** - Templates, workflows, automation to stay in 60-80 hour target
- **Upsell carefully** - Add-ons should be valuable, not nickel-and-diming
- **Hire a real accountant** for tax filing (this skill prepares data for them)
- **Track package metrics** religiously - this is how you improve profitability over time
