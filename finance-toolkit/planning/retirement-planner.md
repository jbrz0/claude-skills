# Retirement Planner

Expert in retirement planning, tax-advantaged account optimization, and long-term wealth accumulation strategies. Help maximize contributions, optimize account types, and build toward financial independence.

## Core Principles

**Time is your biggest advantage**
- Compound growth is exponential
- Start early, even if small
- Consistency beats timing

**Tax optimization matters**
- Pre-tax vs. Roth decisions
- Contribution order of operations
- Withdrawal strategies

**Goal:** Financial independence, not just retirement age

---

## Account Types

### 401(k) / 403(b)

**Employer-sponsored retirement plans**

**Contribution limits (2024):**
- Under 50: $23,000
- Age 50+: $30,500 (extra $7,500 catch-up)
- Total (employee + employer): $69,000

**Traditional 401(k):**
```
Contributions: Pre-tax (reduces current taxable income)
Growth: Tax-deferred
Withdrawals: Taxed as ordinary income

Example:
$100k salary, contribute $20k
Taxable income: $80k (save ~$4,400 in taxes now at 22% bracket)
In retirement: Pay taxes on withdrawals
```

**Roth 401(k):**
```
Contributions: After-tax (no current tax break)
Growth: Tax-free
Withdrawals: Tax-free in retirement

Example:
$100k salary, contribute $20k Roth
Taxable income: Still $100k (pay taxes now)
In retirement: All withdrawals tax-free
```

**Employer match:**
```
Free money, always take it

Example match: 50% up to 6% of salary
Salary: $100k
You contribute: $6k
Employer adds: $3k
Total: $9k (50% instant return)

NEVER leave match on the table
```

**Vesting:**
- Immediate: Keep all employer contributions when you leave
- Graded: 20% per year over 5 years
- Cliff: 0% until 3 years, then 100%

**Check your vesting schedule**

---

### Traditional IRA

**Individual Retirement Account**

**Contribution limits (2024):**
- Under 50: $7,000
- Age 50+: $8,000 (extra $1,000 catch-up)

**Tax treatment:**
```
Contributions: Tax-deductible (income limits apply)
Growth: Tax-deferred  
Withdrawals: Taxed as ordinary income
```

**Deduction phase-outs (if covered by workplace plan):**
```
Single:
- Full deduction: MAGI < $77,000
- Partial: $77,000-$87,000
- None: > $87,000

Married filing jointly:
- Full deduction: MAGI < $123,000
- Partial: $123,000-$143,000
- None: > $143,000

If NOT covered by workplace plan: No income limits
```

**Use cases:**
- No 401(k) available
- After maxing employer match, before maxing 401(k)
- Backdoor Roth IRA contributions (see below)

---

### Roth IRA

**The retirement account cheat code**

**Contribution limits (2024):**
- Same as Traditional IRA: $7,000 ($8,000 if 50+)

**Tax treatment:**
```
Contributions: After-tax (no deduction)
Growth: Tax-free
Withdrawals: Tax-free in retirement (age 59.5+)
```

**Income limits (2024):**
```
Single:
- Full contribution: MAGI < $146,000
- Partial: $146,000-$161,000
- None: > $161,000

Married filing jointly:
- Full contribution: MAGI < $230,000
- Partial: $230,000-$240,000
- None: > $240,000
```

**Why Roth is powerful:**
```
Age 30: Invest $7,000
Growth to age 65: 35 years at 10% = $193,000
Withdrawals: ALL tax-free

Traditional IRA:
Same $193k, but pay 24% taxes = $46k to IRS
Net: $147k

Roth advantage: $46k more in your pocket
```

**Additional benefits:**
- Contributions can be withdrawn anytime (penalty-free)
- No required minimum distributions (RMDs)
- Can pass to heirs tax-free
- No age limit to contribute (if earned income)

---

### Backdoor Roth IRA

**For high earners above income limits**

**The process:**
```
1. Contribute to Traditional IRA (non-deductible)
   $7,000 after-tax contribution
   
2. Immediately convert to Roth IRA
   Pay taxes on any gains (usually $0 if immediate)
   
3. Now it's in Roth, grows tax-free forever

Legal loophole, IRS-approved method
```

**Requirements:**
- Have earned income
- No existing Traditional IRA balance (pro-rata rule issue)

**Pro-rata rule:**
```
If you have existing Traditional IRA with pre-tax money:

Example:
- Existing Trad IRA: $100k (pre-tax)
- New contribution: $7k (after-tax)
- Total: $107k
- After-tax portion: 6.5%

Convert $7k to Roth:
- Taxable amount: $6,545 (93.5%)
- Not a good deal

Solution: Roll existing Trad IRA into 401(k) first (if plan allows)
```

**Mega backdoor Roth:**
```
Advanced strategy if your 401(k) allows:

1. Max regular 401(k): $23,000
2. Add after-tax contributions: Up to $46,000 more
3. Immediately convert to Roth 401(k) or Roth IRA

Total: $69,000/year into Roth accounts

Requirements:
- 401(k) allows after-tax contributions
- 401(k) allows in-service conversions
- High income to fund it

Check with HR if available
```

---

### HSA (Health Savings Account)

**The triple tax-advantaged retirement account**

**Contribution limits (2024):**
- Individual: $4,150
- Family: $8,300
- Age 55+ catch-up: $1,000

**Tax benefits:**
```
1. Contributions: Pre-tax (or deductible if made with after-tax)
2. Growth: Tax-free
3. Withdrawals: Tax-free (for medical expenses)

Only account with triple tax advantage
```

**Requirements:**
- Enrolled in High-Deductible Health Plan (HDHP)
- Minimum deductible (2024): $1,600 individual, $3,200 family
- Maximum out-of-pocket: $8,050 individual, $16,100 family

**Strategy:**
```
1. Max HSA contribution every year
2. Pay medical expenses out-of-pocket
3. Invest HSA funds (don't keep in cash)
4. Save receipts forever
5. Let it grow for decades
6. In retirement: Either reimburse old medical expenses tax-free
   OR use for current medical expenses tax-free
   OR (age 65+) withdraw like Traditional IRA for anything

Functionally becomes a Roth IRA at 65 (but better)
```

**Investment options:**
- Most HSA providers allow investing after certain balance ($1-2k)
- Invest like retirement account (stocks, index funds)
- Don't leave it in cash earning 0.01%

**Portability:**
- Yours forever, even if you change jobs or insurance
- Can rollover to different HSA provider

---

### Taxable Brokerage

**After maxing all tax-advantaged accounts**

**Tax treatment:**
```
Contributions: After-tax
Growth: Taxed annually (dividends, interest)
Withdrawals: Capital gains tax (0%, 15%, or 20% depending on income)
```

**Advantages:**
- No contribution limits
- No withdrawal restrictions or penalties
- Access anytime for any reason
- Flexible for early retirement goals

**Disadvantages:**
- No tax deduction on contributions
- Pay taxes on dividends and realized gains annually
- Less tax-efficient than retirement accounts

**Use for:**
- Early retirement bridge (before 59.5)
- Big purchases (home down payment)
- After maxing $69k in 401(k) + $7k in IRA + $4-8k in HSA

---

## Contribution Priority

**Order of operations for maximum tax efficiency:**

### Priority 1: Employer 401(k) match
```
Contribute enough to get full match

Example: 50% match up to 6%
Salary: $100k
Contribute: $6k minimum
Employer adds: $3k
Total: $9k

This is a 50% instant return
Nothing else compares
```

### Priority 2: High-interest debt
```
If you have debt >7% interest:
Pay that off before additional investing

Credit card at 18%: Guaranteed 18% return by paying it off
Investing: Average 10% return
Math: Pay off debt first
```

### Priority 3: HSA max (if eligible)
```
Contribute: $4,150 (individual) or $8,300 (family)
Why: Triple tax advantage
Invest it, don't touch it
Best retirement account available
```

### Priority 4: Roth IRA max
```
Contribute: $7,000
Why: Tax-free growth, flexibility
Backdoor Roth if over income limit
```

### Priority 5: Max 401(k) contribution
```
Contribute: $23,000 total (includes employer match)
Why: Large tax deferral, more tax-advantaged growth
```

### Priority 6: Mega backdoor Roth (if available)
```
After-tax 401(k) contributions: Up to $46,000 more
Convert to Roth immediately
Why: Huge additional Roth space
```

### Priority 7: Taxable brokerage
```
No limits, full flexibility
Invest for early retirement or other goals
Tax-efficient fund selection (index funds, minimize turnover)
```

**Example allocation:**
```
Salary: $120k
After-tax: ~$90k

1. 401(k) to match (6%): $7,200 â†’ Employer adds $3,600
2. HSA max: $4,150
3. Roth IRA max: $7,000
4. 401(k) additional: $15,800 (total $23k)
5. Total saved: $34,150 in tax-advantaged

Living expenses: $55,850
Savings rate: 28% (not including employer match)
```

---

## Traditional vs. Roth Decision

**The fundamental question:** Pay taxes now or later?

### Choose Traditional (pre-tax) if:

**Current tax rate > Expected retirement tax rate**

```
Scenario: High earner now, moderate spending in retirement

Current:
- Income: $150k
- Tax bracket: 24%
- $20k pre-tax contribution saves: $4,800 now

Retirement:
- Withdrawals: $60k/year
- Tax bracket: 12%
- Pay: $7,200 on $60k

Math: Save 24% now, pay 12% later = win
```

**You want immediate tax benefit**
- Current year tax reduction
- Lowers AGI (may qualify for other deductions)

**You expect lower income in retirement**
- Downsizing lifestyle
- Moving to low-tax state
- More control over taxable income

### Choose Roth (after-tax) if:

**Current tax rate < Expected retirement tax rate**

```
Scenario: Early career, growing income, high net worth in retirement

Current:
- Income: $60k
- Tax bracket: 12%
- $7k Roth contribution costs: $840 in taxes

Retirement:
- Large portfolio, withdrawals + Social Security
- Tax bracket: 24%+
- Roth withdrawals: $0 tax

Math: Pay 12% now, avoid 24% later = win
```

**You want tax diversification**
- Mix of pre-tax and Roth
- Flexibility in retirement tax planning
- Hedge against future tax rate increases

**You expect high income in retirement**
- Large portfolio
- Pension income
- Substantial Social Security
- Rental income
- Continued work

**You're young with long time horizon**
- More time for tax-free growth
- Compounding effect larger

### Optimal strategy: Mix both

**Tax diversification:**
```
Traditional accounts: For standard of living
Roth accounts: For flexibility and upside

Example retirement:
- Need $80k/year
- Take $40k from Traditional (stay in low bracket)
- Take $40k from Roth (tax-free, doesn't count as income)

Benefits:
- Control taxable income
- Minimize Medicare premium surcharges
- Reduce Social Security taxation
- More flexibility
```

**Conversion opportunities:**
```
During low-income years (job loss, sabbatical, early retirement):
- Convert Traditional to Roth
- Pay tax at low rate
- Lock in tax-free growth going forward

Example:
Retire at 55, live off savings until 59.5
Income: Low (no job, not taking 401k yet)
Action: Convert $40k/year from Trad to Roth
Tax: 12% bracket = $4,800
Result: Moved $40k to tax-free status at low rate
```

---

## Asset Location Strategy

**Where you hold investments matters for taxes**

### Tax-efficient placement:

**401(k) / Traditional IRA (taxed as ordinary income at withdrawal):**
- Bonds / bond funds
- REITs (high dividend yield)
- Actively managed funds (high turnover)
- Anything generating ordinary income

**Roth IRA / Roth 401(k) (tax-free forever):**
- High-growth stocks
- Aggressive allocation (100% stocks)
- Investments you expect highest returns
- International stocks (foreign tax credit doesn't help in Roth, but tax-free growth does)

**Taxable brokerage (capital gains rates, annual dividend tax):**
- Tax-efficient index funds (low turnover)
- Municipal bonds (tax-free interest)
- Individual stocks (control gains realization)
- Hold >1 year (long-term capital gains rate)

**Example portfolio:**
```
Total: $300k across accounts

401(k) ($150k):
- 40% bonds
- 20% REITs
- Total: 60% of 401k

Roth IRA ($50k):
- 100% aggressive growth stocks
- Small-cap, emerging markets

Taxable ($100k):
- Total market index fund (VTI)
- Tax-managed funds
- Long-term holds

Result: 
- Bonds in tax-deferred
- High-growth in Roth
- Tax-efficient in taxable
```

---

## Withdrawal Strategies

### Age-based withdrawals:

**Before 59.5:**
```
Limited access to retirement accounts

Available penalty-free:
- Roth IRA contributions (anytime)
- Roth IRA conversions (after 5 years)
- 72(t) distributions (substantially equal periodic payments)
- Rule of 55 (401k if you leave job at 55+)
- Hardship withdrawals (limited, not ideal)

Strategy: Build taxable brokerage for early retirement years
```

**59.5 to 70/72:**
```
Full access to all retirement accounts

Strategy:
- Delay Social Security (grows 8%/year)
- Draw down Traditional IRA/401k (manage tax bracket)
- Roth conversions if income allows
- Preserve Roth for later or heirs
```

**70/72+:**
```
Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) begin

RMD age:
- Born before 1951: Age 70.5
- Born 1951-1959: Age 73
- Born 1960+: Age 75

Must withdraw: Total balance Ã· Life expectancy factor
Penalty if missed: 50% of amount you should have withdrawn

Strategy:
- Plan for forced distributions
- Roth conversions before RMDs begin
- Roth accounts have NO RMDs
```

### Tax-efficient withdrawal order:

**Order during retirement:**

**1. Taxable brokerage (until depleted)**
- Lowest tax drag
- Capital gains rates better than ordinary income
- Preserve tax-advantaged growth longer

**2. Traditional 401(k)/IRA**
- Manage bracket (stay below next tier)
- Required by RMDs eventually anyway

**3. Roth (last, or never)**
- Tax-free
- Best to leave alone
- Great for heirs (inherits tax-free)
- No RMDs

**Exception: If in very low bracket**
```
Retired, before Social Security, low income year:
- Fill up 12% bracket with Traditional withdrawals
- Convert additional to Roth
- Preserve taxable for later
```

---

## Special Situations

### Early retirement (before 59.5)

**Roth IRA conversion ladder:**
```
Strategy for accessing retirement funds penalty-free

Year 1: Convert $50k from Traditional 401k to Roth IRA
Wait 5 years

Year 6: Withdraw that $50k conversion tax and penalty free
Repeat annually

Setup:
Years 1-5: Live off savings/taxable
Year 6+: Access conversions made 5 years ago

Benefits:
- No 10% penalty
- Only pay ordinary income tax on conversion year
- Can manage tax bracket
```

**Rule of 55:**
```
If you leave your job in or after the year you turn 55:
- Can withdraw from THAT employer's 401(k) penalty-free
- Does not apply to IRAs
- Does not apply to previous employers' 401(k)s

Good for: Early retirement at 55-59.5
```

**72(t) SEPP (Substantially Equal Periodic Payments):**
```
Complex IRS rule allowing penalty-free withdrawals

Requirements:
- Must take equal payments
- Continue for 5 years or until age 59.5 (whichever is longer)
- Can't change amount

Risk: Locked into distribution amount, penalties if you mess up

Better options usually available
```

### Job change

**401(k) rollover decision tree:**

```
Option 1: Leave it
âœ“ Good: Institutional pricing, sometimes good fund options
âœ— Bad: Limited control, extra account to track

Option 2: Rollover to new employer 401(k)
âœ“ Good: Consolidation, loan availability
âœ— Bad: New plan may have limited options

Option 3: Rollover to Traditional IRA
âœ“ Good: Unlimited investment options, lower fees
âœ— Bad: Complicates backdoor Roth (pro-rata rule)

Option 4: Convert to Roth IRA
âœ“ Good: Tax-free forever, eliminates RMDs
âœ— Bad: Pay taxes now on full amount (could be huge)
```

**Recommendation:**
```
If planning backdoor Roth: Rollover to new 401(k)
If retiring soon: Leave or Traditional IRA for flexibility
If current 401(k) has great options: Can leave it
If no other considerations: Traditional IRA for control
```

### Inherited retirement accounts

**Rules changed in 2020 (SECURE Act):**

**Spouse beneficiary:**
- Can treat as own IRA
- Or keep as inherited IRA
- No 10-year rule

**Non-spouse beneficiary:**
```
10-year rule: Must withdraw entire account within 10 years

Old rule (pre-2020): Stretch IRA over lifetime
New rule (2020+): Drain in 10 years

Tax implications:
- Forces distributions, potentially in high-income years
- Can significantly increase tax burden

Strategy:
- Withdraw strategically across 10 years
- Manage tax brackets
- Consider Roth inheritance (tax-free)
```

---

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Not taking employer match

```
Situation: Scared of "losing access" to money
Reality: 50-100% instant return

$100k salary, 6% match
Not contributing: Miss $3-6k FREE money
Over 30 years at 10%: Miss $493k-986k

Cost: Catastrophic
```

**Fix:** Always get the match, minimum

### Mistake 2: Cashing out 401(k) when changing jobs

```
$50k 401(k) balance, age 35

Cash out:
- Taxes: 22% federal + 4% state = $13k
- Penalty: 10% = $5k
- Net: $32k

Leave invested until 65 (30 years at 10%):
- $50k â†’ $872k

Cost: $840k to access $32k early
```

**Fix:** Always rollover, never cash out

### Mistake 3: All Traditional or all Roth

```
Problem: No tax diversification

All Traditional:
- Huge RMDs in retirement
- All withdrawals taxed
- No flexibility

All Roth:
- Missed tax deductions in high-earning years
- Paid high rate on conversions

Fix: Mix of both for flexibility
```

### Mistake 4: Not maxing HSA

```
$4,150/year for 30 years at 10%: $684k

Most people: Keep $2k in HSA, don't invest rest
Lost: Hundreds of thousands

Triple tax advantage, but only if invested
```

**Fix:** Max HSA, invest it, don't touch it

### Mistake 5: Waiting to start

```
Start at age 25: $500/month for 40 years = $3.2M
Start at age 35: $500/month for 30 years = $1.1M
Start at age 45: $500/month for 20 years = $380k

Same contribution, different timeline: $2.84M difference

Early years compound the most
```

**Fix:** Start NOW, even if small

---

## Projections & Planning

### Retirement number calculation:

**How much do you need?**

**4% rule:**
```
Annual spending in retirement Ã— 25 = Target nest egg

Example:
- Spending: $80k/year
- Target: $80k Ã— 25 = $2M
- Withdraw 4% annually = $80k

Historically 95% success rate over 30 years
Accounts for inflation, market volatility
```

**Factors to adjust:**
```
Increase target if:
- Retiring very early (50+ year horizon)
- Expensive lifestyle
- Poor health insurance
- No pension/Social Security

Decrease target if:
- Pension income
- Substantial Social Security
- Part-time work
- Willing to adjust spending
```

### Contribution projections:

**What will you have?**

```
Current age: 30
Retirement age: 60
Years: 30

Current balance: $50k
Monthly contribution: $1,500
Annual return: 10%

Future value: $3.4M

At 4% rule: $136k/year in retirement
```

**Catching up:**

```
Behind on retirement savings?

Age 40, $100k saved, need $2M by 65

Required monthly: $2,150

Painful but doable
Better: Start earlier
```

### Monte Carlo analysis:

**Account for uncertainty:**
```
Instead of fixed 10% return:
- Simulate 1,000 scenarios
- Random returns each year
- What % of scenarios succeed?

Target: 80-90% success rate
If lower: Save more or spend less
```

**Tools:**
- FIRECalc
- cFIREsim  
- Personal Capital retirement planner

## Integration with Other Finance Areas

### With Budget Manager
**Contributions are high-priority expenses:**
- Automate retirement contributions
- Treat as non-negotiable bills
- Track against income percentage goals

### With Portfolio Manager
**Retirement accounts are part of allocation:**
- Don't forget 401(k) in total portfolio
- Coordinate across all accounts
- Rebalance across full portfolio

### With Options Trading
**Premium income can boost retirement savings:**
```
Collect $2k/month in premium:
- Reinvest in retirement accounts
- Extra $24k/year = accelerated timeline
- Track separately from W2 income
```

### With Tax Optimizer
**Retirement contributions are tax deductions:**
- Maximize pre-tax contributions in high-income years
- Roth conversions in low-income years
- Coordinate with other tax strategies

---

## Common Questions

**Q: How much should I save for retirement?**
A: Minimum 15% of gross income. 20-30% is better. 50%+ for early retirement.

**Q: Should I pay off my mortgage or invest in retirement accounts?**
A: If mortgage rate < 6%: Max retirement first. If > 6%: Depends on tax situation and risk tolerance.

**Q: Can I retire early if I start at 40?**
A: Possible but requires aggressive saving (40-50%+ rate). Earlier start = much easier.

**Q: What if Social Security isn't there when I retire?**
A: Plan as if you'll get 50-75% of projected benefits. Better to over-save than under-save.

**Q: Should I do Roth or Traditional?**
A: Mix both. Lean Traditional if high earner now, Roth if early career or expect higher income later.

**Q: Is $1M enough to retire?**
A: 4% rule = $40k/year. Enough if low cost of living, modest lifestyle, other income sources. Probably not enough for most people in high COL areas.
