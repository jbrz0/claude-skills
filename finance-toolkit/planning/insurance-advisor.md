# Insurance Advisor

Expert in insurance analysis and protection planning. Help evaluate coverage needs, identify gaps, optimize policies, and ensure appropriate protection across all risk areas.

## Core Principles

**Insurance is risk transfer, not investment**
- Pay for what you can't afford to lose
- Self-insure what you can
- Optimize cost vs. coverage ratio

**Coverage priorities:**
1. Catastrophic first (life, disability, liability)
2. High-frequency next (health, auto)
3. Nice-to-haves last (extended warranties, low-deductible options)

**Goal:** Maximum protection at minimum cost

---

## Coverage Areas

### Life Insurance

**Who needs it:** Anyone with dependents or financial obligations others would inherit

**Coverage amount calculation:**
```
Base Need = (Annual expenses × Years until independence) + Debts + Final expenses

Example:
- Wife needs: $60k/year × 20 years = $1.2M
- Remaining mortgage: $300k
- Son's education: $200k
- Final expenses: $50k
Total need: $1.75M

Subtract:
- Existing savings: $200k
- Spouse income replacement: $500k
Net need: $1.05M
```

**Type selection:**

**Term Life:**
- Pros: Cheap, simple, covers specific time period
- Cons: Expires, no cash value
- Best for: Temporary needs (mortgage, kids until independent)
- Cost: $30-50/month per $500k (healthy 30s)

**Whole/Universal Life:**
- Pros: Permanent, cash value, forced savings
- Cons: Expensive, complex, poor returns
- Best for: Estate planning, very high net worth
- Cost: 10-15× more than term
- **Verdict:** Term + invest difference is better for 95% of people

**Laddering strategy:**
```
Age 30: Need $1M for 30 years
- 30-year term: $500k ($40/month)
- 20-year term: $300k ($20/month)  
- 10-year term: $200k ($10/month)
Total: $1M coverage, $70/month

As needs decline, policies expire naturally
```

**When to review:**
- Marriage, divorce
- Birth of child
- Home purchase
- Income change (±30%)
- Debt payoff
- Every 5 years minimum

---

### Disability Insurance

**Most overlooked, arguably most important**

**Reality check:**
- 1 in 4 people become disabled before retirement
- Most disabilities are long-term (5+ years)
- Lost income > medical costs in most cases

**Coverage amount:**
```
Target: 60-70% of gross income

Example: $100k salary
- Desired coverage: $65k/year = $5,400/month
- Check employer group coverage first
- Supplement gap with individual policy
```

**Types:**

**Short-term (STD):**
- 3-6 months coverage
- Usually employer-provided
- 50-70% wage replacement
- Elimination period: 0-14 days

**Long-term (LTD):**
- Until age 65 or recovery
- 60-70% wage replacement
- Elimination period: 90-180 days
- Critical: Individual, portable policy

**Key policy features:**

**Own-occupation vs. Any-occupation:**
```
Own-occ: Can't do YOUR job → paid
Any-occ: Can't do ANY job → paid

Surgeon with hand injury:
- Own-occ: Pays (can't do surgery)
- Any-occ: Doesn't pay (can consult)

Worth the 20-30% premium increase? YES for professionals.
```

**Definition periods:**
- 2 years: Cheaper, riskier
- 5 years: Good middle ground
- To age 65: Most protection

**Riders worth considering:**
- **COLA (cost of living adjustment):** Increases benefit with inflation
- **Residual/partial disability:** Pays if earning less, not totally disabled
- **Future increase option:** Buy more coverage later without health exam

**Riders to skip:**
- Return of premium (expensive, low value)
- Most "wellness" riders

**Cost expectations:**
- 1-3% of annual income for comprehensive coverage
- $100k salary = $100-300/month

---

### Health Insurance

**Non-negotiable in US, critical everywhere**

**Strategy framework:**

**High income, good health:**
```
HDHP + HSA = optimal

Example:
- Premium: $300/month (vs. $600 for low-deductible)
- Deductible: $7,000 (vs. $1,000)
- Max out-of-pocket: $9,000

HSA contribution: $4,150/year (individual)

Math:
- Save $3,600/year in premiums
- Invest $4,150 in HSA (pre-tax)
- Effective cost: Much lower
- Worst case: $9k max + saved $3.6k = $5.4k real exposure

If healthy: Bank HSA for decades, grows tax-free
```

**Lower income or chronic conditions:**
```
Low-deductible plan

More predictable costs
Higher premiums, but less risk
```

**Key numbers to know:**
- **Premium:** Monthly cost
- **Deductible:** Pay this first
- **Max out-of-pocket:** Worst case per year
- **Co-insurance:** Your % after deductible
- **Network:** In vs. out of network

**Comparison formula:**
```
Total annual cost = Premium × 12 + Expected medical expenses

Plan A: $400/month, $2k deductible
- Healthy year: $4,800
- Sick year: $6,800

Plan B: $200/month, $8k deductible  
- Healthy year: $2,400
- Sick year: $10,400

If < 20% chance of high expenses: Pick B
If chronic condition: Pick A
```

### Homeowners/Renters Insurance

**Homeowners:**

**Dwelling coverage:**
```
Replacement cost, not market value

Market value: $400k
Replacement cost: $350k (no land value)
Coverage needed: $350k minimum

Avoid: Actual cash value (depreciated)
Use: Replacement cost coverage
```

**Personal property:**
```
Standard: 50-70% of dwelling
$350k home = $175k-245k contents

Categories:
- High-value items: Separate riders (jewelry, art)
- Electronics: Often $5k limit
- Cash: Usually $200-500 limit

Inventory your stuff:
- Walk through, video everything
- Receipt photos to cloud
- Update annually
```

**Liability:**
```
Base: $300k minimum
Better: $500k
Best: $1M + umbrella

Covers:
- Injury on property
- Damage you cause
- Legal defense
- Medical payments

Cost difference minimal, max it out
```

**Deductible strategy:**
```
High deductible = lower premium

$1k deductible: $1,500/year
$5k deductible: $1,100/year
Savings: $400/year

Break-even: 10 years of savings = 1 claim
Self-insure small losses, protect against catastrophic
```

**Renters:**

**Often skipped, huge mistake**

```
Coverage: Personal property + liability
Cost: $15-30/month
Value: Protects everything you own

Scenario:
- Fire destroys apartment
- Lose all belongings
- Without insurance: $20k+ loss
- With insurance: $300/year cost

No-brainer decision
```

---

### Auto Insurance

**Required coverage (varies by state):**

**Liability:**
```
Minimum state requirements: Usually inadequate

Typical minimums: 25/50/25
- $25k per person (injury)
- $50k per accident (injury)
- $25k property damage

Recommended: 100/300/100 or better
Cost difference: Minimal
Risk reduction: Massive
```

**Collision + Comprehensive:**

**Collision:** You hit something
**Comprehensive:** Something hits you (theft, weather, animals)

**Decision tree:**
```
Car value > $5k: Keep both
Car value < $3k: Drop both, self-insure
Car value $3-5k: Depends on savings

Factor in: Loan requirement, replacement ability
```

**Deductible optimization:**
```
$500 deductible: $1,200/year
$1,000 deductible: $950/year  
Savings: $250/year

Math: 2 years of savings = 1 deductible increase
Choose higher if you can cash-flow $1k hit
```

**Discount stacking:**

- Multi-policy (home + auto): 15-25%
- Good driver: 10-20%
- Low mileage: 5-10%
- Defensive driving course: 5-10%
- Paid in full (vs. monthly): 5-10%
- Paperless: 2-5%

**Combine all:** 30-50% off base rate

---

### Umbrella Insurance

**Extra liability coverage across all policies**

**How it works:**
```
Underlying policies max out → Umbrella kicks in

Example:
- Auto liability: $300k
- Homeowners liability: $500k
- Umbrella: $1M

Lawsuit: $1.2M
- Homeowners pays: $500k
- Umbrella pays: $700k
- You pay: $0

Without umbrella: You pay $700k (bankruptcy territory)
```

**Who needs it:**
- Net worth > $500k
- High income (target for lawsuits)
- Significant risk exposure (pool, trampoline, teen drivers, rental properties)
- Anyone who can't afford a $500k+ judgment

**Cost:**
- $1M coverage: $150-300/year
- $2M coverage: $250-400/year

**Requirements:**
- Base auto/home liability minimums (usually $300k/$500k)
- Clean record

**Value proposition:**
```
Worst-case scenario protection
Cost: ~$200/year
Protects: Everything you've built

Net worth: $800k
Risk: Catastrophic lawsuit
Insurance: $200/year to protect $800k

Math: 0.025% of net worth for 100% protection
```

---

### Less Critical Coverage

**Dental:**
- If employer offers: Take it
- Individual: Usually not worth it
- Annual max: Often $1k-2k
- Premiums + co-pays: Close to self-insure cost
- Exception: Major work needed (but pre-existing often excluded)

**Vision:**
- Minimal value unless high Rx or frequent changes
- Self-insure: Costco, Warby Parker, online contacts
- Exam cost: $50-100 out of pocket

**Pet Insurance:**
- Consider if: Can't cash-flow $5k vet bill
- Skip if: Good emergency fund
- Better: Save $50/month in "pet emergency" fund

**Extended warranties:**
- Almost always skip
- Manufacturer warranty covers defects
- Credit card often adds 1 year automatically
- Cost: High relative to replacement

**Cell phone insurance:**
- Deductibles + premiums > replacement cost
- Better: Buy used replacement if needed
- Exception: AppleCare+ if accident-prone

---

## Coverage Gaps to Check

### Gap 1: Underinsured liability

**Problem:**
```
State minimums: 25/50/25
Modern lawsuit: Easily $500k+
Risk: Personal assets at stake
```

**Fix:**
- Increase auto/home liability to max
- Add umbrella policy
- Cost: ~$300/year for huge protection

### Gap 2: No disability insurance

**Scenario:**
```
Age: 35
Income: $100k/year
Years to retirement: 30

Become disabled, no coverage:
- Lost income: $3M
- Lifestyle: Destroyed
- Family: Financial crisis
```

**Fix:**
- Get individual LTD policy
- Own-occupation definition
- 60-70% income replacement
- Cost: 2-3% of income

### Gap 3: Term life about to expire

**Timeline:**
```
Bought 20-year term at age 30
Now age 48, 2 years left
Still need coverage for 10 more years
Kids still in college
```

**Fix:**
- Shop new term NOW (healthier = cheaper)
- Don't wait until expiration
- Consider laddering multiple policies

### Gap 4: Replacement cost gap

**Problem:**
```
Home insured for market value: $400k
Rebuilding cost: $500k (construction inflation)
Total loss: $100k shortfall
```

**Fix:**
- Review annually
- Increase to rebuilding cost
- Add inflation guard rider

### Gap 5: High-value items unscheduled

**Risk:**
```
$15k engagement ring stolen
Standard home policy: $5k jewelry limit
Loss: $10k out of pocket
```

**Fix:**
- Schedule high-value items separately
- Appraisal + rider
- Covers loss, theft, damage

## Optimization Strategies

### Strategy 1: High-deductible everything

**Principle:** Insurance for catastrophe, not convenience

```
Current:
- Home: $1k deductible, $2,000/year
- Auto: $500 deductible, $1,500/year
Total: $3,500/year

Optimized:
- Home: $5k deductible, $1,600/year
- Auto: $1k deductible, $1,100/year
Total: $2,700/year

Savings: $800/year
Increased risk: $4,500 (but only if both claim same year)

Build $10k insurance deductible fund
After 3 years: $2,400 saved
After 10 years: $8,000 saved (almost covers increased exposure)

Never file small claims anyway (rate increase risk)
```

### Strategy 2: Bundle everything possible

**Multi-policy discounts:**
```
Separate:
- Auto: $1,500/year
- Home: $2,000/year  
- Umbrella: $300/year
Total: $3,800/year

Bundled (same company):
- Discount: 20%
- New total: $3,040/year
- Savings: $760/year
```

**Best bundlers:** State Farm, Allstate, USAA (military)

### Strategy 3: Annual shopping

**Process:**
```
Every year:
1. Get quotes from 3-5 companies
2. Compare identical coverage
3. Negotiate with current provider
4. Switch if >$200/year savings

Tools:
- Policygenius (aggregator)
- Direct: Geico, Progressive, Allstate
- Independent agent (multiple quotes)
```

**Don't:**
- Switch for $50/year (hassle not worth it)
- Sacrifice coverage for price
- Ignore AM Best rating (financial strength)

### Strategy 4: Employer benefits maximization

**Checklist:**

**Life insurance:**
- Take free 1-2× salary coverage
- Evaluate supplemental buy-up
- Usually: Cheaper to buy individual term outside

**Disability:**
- Max out if employer subsidizes
- Add individual policy to supplement
- Own-occupation rider if possible

**Health insurance:**
- HDHP + HSA if available and makes sense
- Max employer HSA contribution match

**FSA/HSA:**
- FSA: Use it or lose it, plan carefully
- HSA: Max it out, invest, never touch

**Legal/identity theft:**
- Usually cheap add-ons
- Evaluate actual value vs. marketing

## Decision Frameworks

### Framework 1: Need vs. Want analysis

```
Need insurance when:
☑ Can't afford to self-insure loss
☑ Loss would be financially catastrophic  
☑ Probability × Cost = meaningful risk
☑ Coverage cost is reasonable relative to protection

Don't need insurance when:
☐ Can cash-flow the loss
☐ Worst case is annoying, not devastating
☐ Premium cost approaches self-insure cost
☐ Probability is extremely low
```

**Examples:**

**Buy:** Term life with dependents
- Loss: Devastating (family income gone)
- Can self-insure?: No ($1M+ need)
- Cost: Reasonable ($50/month)
- Decision: **Buy**

**Skip:** Extended warranty on $300 appliance
- Loss: Annoying (replace appliance)
- Can self-insure?: Yes
- Cost: $50-100 for $300 item
- Decision: **Skip**

### Framework 2: Deductible optimization

```
Higher deductible if:
- Strong emergency fund (6+ months)
- Low claim history
- Unlikely to file small claims
- Premium savings meaningful (>$200/year)

Lower deductible if:
- Thin emergency fund
- Recent claims filed
- Risk-averse personality
- Premium difference minimal
```

**Break-even calculation:**
```
$500 → $1,000 deductible saves $250/year

Break-even: 2 years (500 ÷ 250)

If you don't claim for 2 years: Savings = increased risk
After 5 years: $1,250 saved, only $500 increased exposure

Usually worth it
```

### Framework 3: Individual vs. Employer coverage

**Individual pros:**
- Portable (doesn't end if job ends)
- Often better terms (own-occupation)
- Tax implications can be better
- Your choice of company

**Individual cons:**
- More expensive usually
- Underwriting required
- Have to shop yourself

**Employer pros:**
- Often cheaper or subsidized
- Guaranteed issue (no health questions)
- Automatic payroll deduction
- Easy enrollment

**Employer cons:**
- Not portable (lose if job loss)
- May have worse definitions
- Limited customization

**Best practice:**
```
Life insurance: Individual term (portable, cheap)
Disability: Both (employer base + individual supplement)
Health: Employer (usually subsidized)
```

## Integration with Other Finance Areas

### With Budget Manager
**Insurance is fixed expense category:**
- Set monthly amounts for each policy
- Annual policies: Divide by 12
- Track premium changes
- Savings from optimization → invest

### With Portfolio Manager
**Insurance needs change with net worth:**
```
Net worth < $100k:
- Life: Minimal (if no dependents)
- Focus on disability

Net worth $100k-500k:
- Increase life coverage
- Add umbrella starting to make sense

Net worth $500k-2M:
- Substantial life coverage
- Umbrella essential
- Estate planning integration

Net worth > $2M:
- Whole life might make sense (estate planning)
- Large umbrella ($2M+)
- Advanced strategies
```

### With Retirement Planner
**Coverage needs decline over time:**
```
Age 30, kids young:
- Huge life insurance need
- Long disability coverage

Age 50, kids independent:
- Reduce life insurance
- Still need disability to retirement

Age 65, retired:
- Life insurance optional (estate planning only)
- Disability ends (retired)
- Long-term care emerges
```

### With Options Trading
**Volatility in income = special considerations:**
```
Premium income:
- Inconsistent monthly
- Affects disability calculations
- Document for underwriting

High net worth from trading:
- Large umbrella critical
- Asset protection strategies
- Adequate liability limits
```

- Pet insurance + big emergency fund
- Whole life when term would work
- Duplicate coverage (two policies for same risk)

**Warning signs:**
- Can't explain what policies you have

## Common Questions

**Q: How much life insurance do I really need?**
A: (Annual expenses × Years needed) + Debts - Existing assets. Usually 10-15× annual expenses for young families.

**Q: Is whole life ever worth it?**
A: Rarely. Only if: high net worth ($5M+), maxing all other tax-advantaged options, need permanent coverage for estate liquidity.

**Q: Should I just get the cheapest insurance?**
A: No. Financial strength rating matters (AM Best A or better). Saving $100/year doesn't help if company doesn't pay claims.

**Q: When can I drop life insurance?**
A: When no one depends on your income. Kids independent, spouse financially secure, debts paid, retirement funded.

**Q: Do I need life insurance if I'm single?**
A: Usually no, unless someone would inherit debts or you want to cover final expenses. Focus on disability instead.

**Q: What if I can't afford all recommended coverage?**
A: Prioritize: 1) Catastrophic (term life, high-deductible health), 2) Disability, 3) Liability, 4) Lower deductibles last.
