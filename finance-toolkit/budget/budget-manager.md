### Tracking Methods

**Option 1: Manual (Google Sheets)**
- Weekly: Log transactions
- Categorize expenses
- Update running totals

**Option 2: Automated (Mint, YNAB, Personal Capital)**
- Auto-import transactions
- Review and categorize
- Export to your sheet

**Hybrid (Recommended):**
- Auto-import major accounts
- Manual log for cash/misc
- Reconcile weekly

## Monthly Review Process

### Week 1: Quick Check
- Log week's expenses
- Check vs budget
- Flag any overages
- Adjust if needed

### Week 2-3: Mid-month Review
- Pace check: on track?
- Any surprises?
- Adjust discretionary spending

### Week 4: Month-end Close
- Final transaction logging
- Categorize everything
- Calculate actuals
- Compare to budget

### Start of Next Month: Analysis

**1. Variance Analysis**
```
For each category over/under by >10%:
- Why? One-time or pattern?
- Acceptable or needs fixing?
- Action for next month
```

**2. Trend Spotting**
```
Compare last 3 months:
- Which categories trending up?
- Which trending down?
- Seasonal factors?
- Lifestyle changes?
```

**3. Optimization Opportunities**
```
- Can any fixed costs be reduced?
- Subscriptions not using?
- Better deals available?
- Waste to eliminate?
```

**4. Goal Progress**
```
- Savings rate: target vs actual
- Emergency fund: current level
- Debt paydown: on track?
- Investment goals: progress
```

## Budget Optimization Strategies

### The $10 Rule
**Every $10/month saved = $120/year**

Small optimizations compound:
- Cancel $10 subscription = $120/year
- Meal prep saves $15/week = $780/year
- Coffee at home saves $5/day = $1,825/year

### Zero-Sum Categories
**Overspent in one? Underspend in another**

Example:
- Went over dining by $100
- Reduce shopping by $100
- Net zero impact on total budget

### Sinking Funds
**Predictable irregular expenses**

Set aside monthly for:
- Annual insurance premiums
- Car registration
- Holiday gifts
- Vacation
- Home maintenance

Monthly amount = Annual cost ÷ 12

### Envelope System (Digital)
**Allocate dollars to categories**

When category "envelope" empty, stop spending:
- Dining: $300/month → Track as you go
- Entertainment: $150/month → Stop when depleted
- Shopping: $200/month → Forces discipline

### The 50/30/20 Rule
**Simple allocation:**
- 50% Needs (fixed + essential)
- 30% Wants (discretionary)
- 20% Savings/investments

Adjust ratios based on your goals.

### Pay Yourself First
**Automate savings:**
1. Income arrives
2. Savings automatically transferred
3. Live on what's left

**Set up:**
- Auto-transfer to savings day after payday
- Auto-increase 401k contribution
- Auto-invest to brokerage

## Category Deep Dives

### Food Optimization
**Typical problem area**

**Track:**
- Groceries vs dining out ratio
- Cost per meal
- Waste (food thrown away)

**Optimize:**
- Meal planning (weekly)
- Batch cooking (meal prep)
- Strategic dining out (special only)
- Grocery list discipline

**Target:** $X per person per month

### Subscription Audit
**See: subscription-audit skill**

Regular review of all recurring charges:
- Streaming services
- Software/apps
- Memberships
- Magazines/newsletters

Ask: Still using? Worth it? Cheaper alternative?

### Transportation
**Often underestimated**

**Track:**
- Gas: [miles ÷ MPG × $ per gallon]
- Maintenance: [annual ÷ 12]
- Insurance: [annual ÷ 12]
- Registration: [annual ÷ 12]
- Depreciation: [(purchase - resale) ÷ years owned ÷ 12]

**True cost per mile:** Total annual ÷ miles driven

### Discretionary Spending
**Where budget flexibility lives**

**Entertainment:**
- Set monthly cap
- Track per event
- Free alternatives?

**Shopping:**
- 24-hour rule (wait before buying)
- Need vs want distinction
- Cost per use calculation

## Budget Scenarios

### Variable Income (Options Premium)
**Problem:** Income fluctuates month to month

**Solution:**
1. Base budget on minimum guaranteed income
2. Premium income = extra savings/investing
3. Don't lifestyle inflate with windfalls

**Track separately:**
```
Base Budget: $X (fixed salary)
Bonus Pool: $Y (options, freelance, etc.)

Bonus allocation:
- 50% additional investing
- 25% savings
- 25% guilt-free spending
```

### Unexpected Expense
**Problem:** Car repair, medical bill, etc.

**Decision tree:**
1. Emergency fund sufficient? → Use it
2. Not emergency, can wait? → Sinking fund next month
3. True emergency, no fund? → Cut discretionary hard + payment plan

**Replenish emergency fund ASAP**

### Overspent Month
**Problem:** Blew past budget significantly

**Response:**
1. Analyze: Why? One-time or pattern?
2. Short-term: Cut discretionary next month to compensate
3. Long-term: If pattern, budget was unrealistic → adjust

**Don't:** Beat yourself up, give up, hide from it

### Income Windfall
**Problem:** Bonus, tax refund, inheritance

**Allocation formula:**
- 50% long-term savings/investing
- 25% short-term goals
- 25% enjoy (guilt-free)

**Avoid:** Lifestyle inflation, impulse buys

- **Surplus/deficit:** Cash flow

### Quarterly
- **Category trends:** 3-month moving average
- **Savings rate trend:** Improving or declining?
- **Net worth change:** Assets - Liabilities
- **Emergency fund:** Months of expenses covered

### Annually
- **Total income:** All sources
- **Total expenses:** All categories

- **Annual savings rate:** Whole year average
- **Year-over-year:** Compare to last year

## Common Questions

**Q: How much emergency fund?**
A: 3-6 months expenses. More if variable income, less if very stable job + good insurance.

**Q: Should I pay off debt or save?**
A: Depends on interest rate. High interest (>7%) → aggressive payoff. Low interest (<4%) → minimal payments, invest difference.

**Q: What's a good savings rate?**
A: Aim for 20% minimum. 30-50% for FIRE goals. <20% makes wealth building very slow.

**Q: How tight should my budget be?**
A: Tight enough to save meaningfully, loose enough to stick with it. If you hate it, you'll quit.

**Q: How do I handle irregular expenses?**
A: Sinking funds - estimate annual, divide by 12, set aside monthly.
