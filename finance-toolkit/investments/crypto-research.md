## Research Process

### Phase 1: Initial Screening (10 min)

**Quick filters:**

**Basic info:**
- [ ] What is it? (1-sentence description)
- [ ] What problem does it solve?
- [ ] Why does it need a blockchain?
- [ ] Why does it need a token?

**Quick metrics:**
- Market cap: $X (rank #X)
- Fully diluted valuation: $X
- Trading volume 24h: $X
- Launched: [Year]
- All-time high: $X (current from ATH: -X%)

**First impression:**
- Pass → Deep dive
- Fail → Move on
- Interesting but speculative → Small position only

### Phase 2: Project Fundamentals (30 min)

**Deep understanding of the project**

**Problem and solution:**
- What problem exists?
- How does this project solve it?
- Why is crypto/blockchain needed?
- What's the alternative (non-crypto solution)?

**Team:**
```
Founders:
- Names and backgrounds
- Previous projects (successful?)
- Public profiles (LinkedIn, Twitter)
- Skin in the game (token holdings?)

Team size: X people
Notable team members: [List]
Advisors: [If impressive]

Red flags:
- Anonymous team (unless Bitcoin)
- No crypto experience
- Previous failures
- Token dump history
```

**Backers:**
```
VC funding: $X raised
Notable investors: [List]
Investor unlock schedule: [Important]
```

**Roadmap:**
- Current stage (idea / testnet / mainnet / mature)
- Key milestones achieved
- Upcoming milestones
- Behind schedule? (red flag)
- Overpromising? (red flag)

**Competition:**
```
Direct competitors:
1. [Project A]: [How they compare]
2. [Project B]: [How they compare]

Competitive advantages:
- First mover?
- Better tech?
- Stronger network effects?
- More capital?

Market position: Leader / Challenger / Niche
```

### Phase 3: Tokenomics (30 min)

**Critical for crypto - most important section**

**Token supply:**
```
Max supply: X tokens (or unlimited/inflationary)
Circulating supply: X tokens (X% of max)
Locked/vested: X tokens (X% of max)

Inflation rate: X% per year
Halving/reduction schedule: [If applicable]

Comparison:
- Bitcoin: 21M fixed (deflationary)
- Ethereum: Unlimited but capped inflation post-merge
- [This project]: [Supply model]
```

**Token distribution:**
```
Team/founders: X%
Investors: X%
Community/public: X%
Treasury/DAO: X%
Ecosystem incentives: X%

Red flag if:
- Team + investors >50%
- Public <20%
- No long-term vesting
```

**Vesting schedule:**
```
Team tokens:
- X% locked for Y years
- Linear unlock over Z years
- First unlock: [Date]

Investor tokens:
- Cliff: X months
- Unlock schedule: [Details]

Calculate: When is major unlock? (sell pressure)
```

**Token utility:**
```
Use cases:
- [ ] Governance (voting on proposals)
- [ ] Staking (earn rewards)
- [ ] Fee payment (discounts for using token)
- [ ] Collateral (can borrow against it)
- [ ] Revenue share (protocol fees distributed)
- [ ] Burns (token supply reduces)

Strong utility = multiple use cases + fee accrual
Weak utility = just governance (vote on what?)
```

**Value accrual:**
```
How does token capture value from protocol success?

Best: Fee revenue → Token holders
  Example: GMX fees distributed to stakers

Good: Burns from fee revenue
  Example: BNB burns from exchange fees

Weak: Just governance + speculative
  Example: UNI (no fee share yet)
```

**Token velocity:**
- High velocity = people sell quickly (bearish)
- Low velocity = people hold (bullish)
- Staking/locking reduces velocity

### Phase 4: Technology Analysis (20 min)

```
For L1s:
- Consensus mechanism: [PoW, PoS, other]

For L2s:
- Scaling approach: [Rollup, sidechain, etc.]
- Base chain: [Which L1]
- Security model: [Inherited or separate]
```

**Smart contracts:**
```
Smart contract platform: Yes/No
Language: Solidity / Rust / Other

Real or just MOUs? (Memorandum of Understanding = often meaningless)
```

### Phase 6: On-Chain Analysis (15 min)

**Blockchain doesn't lie - verify claims**

**Address analysis:**
```
Total addresses: X
Active addresses (7d): X
New addresses (7d): X
Growth rate: +/- X%

Whale concentration:
Top 10 holders: X% of supply
Top 100 holders: X% of supply

Concern if >50% in top 100 (centralized)
```

**Transaction analysis:**
```
Daily transactions: X
Transaction volume: $X
Average transaction: $X
Fees paid: $X

Trends:
- Increasing = adoption growing
- Decreasing = interest waning
```

**Exchange analysis:**
```
Exchange netflow:
- Inflow = selling pressure (bearish)
- Outflow = accumulation (bullish)

Exchange supply: X% of total

Current trend: [Flowing in or out?]
```

**Holder behavior:**
```
Long-term holders (>1 year): X%
Short-term holders (<3 months): X%

Wallet age distribution:
- Strong hands (old wallets holding)
- Weak hands (new wallets, quick flips)
```

**Network value metrics:**
```
NVT Ratio (Network Value to Transactions):
= Market cap / Daily transaction volume
Lower = better value

Mayer Multiple (for Bitcoin):
= Price / 200-day MA
<1 = undervalued, >2.5 = overvalued

Realized cap:
= Value of all coins at price when last moved
Compare to market cap for value assessment
```

### Phase 7: Risk Assessment (15 min)

**Crypto is high risk - what could go wrong?**

**Protocol risks:**
- Smart contract bugs (history of hacks?)
- Centralization (small team controls too much?)
- Reliance on key infrastructure (oracle failure?)
- Governance attack (51% attack possible?)

**Market risks:**
- High volatility (can handle -50% swings?)
- Low liquidity (hard to exit large position?)
- Regulatory uncertainty (could be banned?)
- Competition (better project launches?)

**Token risks:**
- Major unlocks coming (sell pressure?)
- Death spiral (staking yields unsustainable?)
- Value accrual unclear (why should token go up?)
- Team dump risk (previous projects?)

**Adoption risks:**
- Product not needed (solution looking for problem?)
- Can't scale (technology limitations?)
- User experience poor (too complex?)
- Network effects not materializing (empty marketplace?)

**Overall risk level:** Low / Medium / High / Extreme

**Only invest what you can afford to lose** (especially true for crypto)

- Institutional adoption (ETFs, corporate treasuries)
- Network security (never hacked in 15+ years)

**Bitcoin = Different beast than alts**

## Ethereum Specific Analysis

**Dominant smart contract platform:**

**Metrics:**
- DApp ecosystem size
- Developer activity (most developers)
- DeFi TVL (highest)
- NFT market (largest)
- L2 ecosystem (Arbitrum, Optimism, etc.)

**Post-merge:**
- Staking yield (~4%)
- Deflationary (burning more than issuing)
- Energy consumption (-99.95%)

**Ethereum = Crypto's foundation**

## Common Crypto Mistakes

❌ **Don't:**
- Buy based on Twitter hype
- FOMO into pumps
- Ignore tokenomics
- Over-allocate (crypto should be small % of portfolio)
- Fall for promises (99% of projects fail)
- Leave crypto on exchanges (not your keys, not your coins)
- Chase quick riches (usually lose money)
- Ignore security (use hardware wallet)
- Trade too much (taxes + fees kill returns)

✅ **Do:**
- Research thoroughly first
- Understand tokenomics deeply
- Buy quality projects
- DCA to reduce timing risk
- Take profits on the way up
- Use hardware wallet for large amounts
- Think long-term (1+ year)
- Only invest what you can lose
- Pay attention to unlocks

- CoinGecko / CoinMarketCap (prices, market caps)
- Messari (research, tokenomics)
- DeFi Llama (TVL, protocol metrics)
- Dune Analytics (on-chain data)
- Glassnode (on-chain analytics)

**News:**

## Integration with Other Skills

### With Portfolio Manager
**Crypto allocation management:**
- Crypto portion of portfolio: [X]% max
- Rebalancing when allocation drifts
- Position sizing per coin
- Risk management

### With Tax Optimizer
**Crypto taxes are complex:**
- Every trade is taxable event
- Track cost basis carefully
- Harvest losses strategically
- Hold >1 year for long-term gains
- Use tax software (CoinTracker, Koinly)

### With Options Trading
**Some overlap:**
- Can sell covered calls on COIN, MSTR (BTC proxy)
- Options less liquid on crypto
- Extreme volatility = wider strikes

## Deliverables

For each crypto researched:
1. **Research report:** Full analysis
2. **Tokenomics breakdown:** Supply, distribution, utility
3. **Risk assessment:** All categories of risk
4. **Investment thesis:** Bull/bear cases
5. **Recommendation:** Buy/hold/pass with sizing

## Next Steps

To research a crypto project:
1. [ ] Provide ticker/name (BTC, ETH, SOL, etc.)
2. [ ] I'll gather project data and news
3. [ ] Analyze fundamentals, tokenomics, adoption
4. [ ] Generate formatted research report
5. [ ] Make recommendation with risk assessment
